1475, A sample note on Rheumatoid Arthritis, Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis ,"RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, (or RA) is a chronic, systemic condition with primary involvement of the joints.  Joint inflammation is present due to an abnormal immune response in which the body attacks its own tissue.  Specifically, the tissues lining the joint are involved as well as cartilage and muscle and sometimes the eyes and blood vessels.  The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is obscure but it is associated with a family history, genetic and autoimmune problems, people ages 20-60, female gender 3:1 or a Native American background.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,*  Joint pain, swelling, redness, warmth.  Commonly involved joints are the small joints of the hands and feet and the ankles, wrists, knees, shoulders and elbows.,*  Multiple swollen joints (more than 3) with simultaneous involvement of same joints on opposite side of the body.,*  Morning stiffness that lasts longer than 30 minutes.,*  Difficulty making a fist; poor grip strength.,*  Night pain.,*  Feeling ""sick"" - low fever, loss of appetite, tiredness, generalized aching and stiffness, weakness.,*  Rheumatoid nodules under the skin, usually along the surface of tendons or over bony prominences.,*  Disease may lead to deformed joints, decreased vision, anemia, muscle weakness, peripheral nerve problems, pericarditis, enlarged spleen, increased frequency of infections.,*  Blood tests will reveal a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) to be present the majority of the time.,TREATMENT:,*  To diagnose RA, blood studies are done to detect a substance known as rheumatoid factor and x-rays may show typical findings.,*  Night splints for involved joints.  Avoid putting a pillow under the knees as this will contribute to joint contracture.,*  Heat helps relieve the pain; hot water soaks, whirlpool baths, heat lamps, heating pads, etc. applied to affected joints 15-20 minutes 3 times per day is helpful.,*  Sleep on a firm mattress and sleep at least 10-12 hours per night.  Get rest during the day; take naps.,*  Get bed rest during an active flare-up until symptoms subside.,*  Avoid humid weather if possible.,*  NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).,*  DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) - gold compounds, D-penicillamine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, antimalarials.,*  Immunosuppressive drugs.,*  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief only when necessary.,*  Oral corticosteroids short term; corticosteroid injection into joint can temporarily relieve pain and inflammation.,*  Exercise as recommended by your physician.  Exercise helps keep the joints limber and increases strength.  Swimming and water activities are a good way to workout.  Put all your joints through their full ranges of motion every day to prevent contractures. *  Physical therapy may be recommended.,*  Surgical intervention.,*  Lose excess weight as being overweight will only stress the joints further.,*  Eat a normal, well-balanced diet.","rheumatology, ra, rheumatoid arthritis, joint inflammation, swollen joints, arthritis, joints, inflammation, corticosteroids, rheumatoid, "

She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis for the last 6 years.  She was followed by another rheumatologist.  She says she has been off and on, on prednisone and Arava.  The rheumatologist, as per the patient, would not want her to be on a long-term medicine, so he would give her prednisone and then switch to Arava and then switch her back to prednisone.  She says she had been on prednisone for the last 6 to 9 months.  She is on 5 mg a day.  She recently had a left BKA and there was a question of infection, so it had to be debrided.  I was consulted to see if her prednisone is to be continued.  The patient denies any joint pains at the present time.

She is not on DMARD, but as she recently had a surgery followed by a probable infection, I will hold off on that.  As she has no pain, I have decreased the prednisone to 2.5 mg a day starting tomorrow if she is to go back to her nursing home tomorrow.  If in a couple of weeks her symptoms stay the same, then I would discontinue the prednisone.  I would defer that to Dr. X.  If she flares up at that point, prednisone may have to be restarted with a DMARD, so that eventually she could stay off the prednisone.  I discussed this at length with the patient and she is in full agreement with the plan.  I explained to her that if she is to be discharged, if she wishes, she could follow up with me in clinic or if she goes back to Victoria, then see her rheumatologist over there.","rheumatology, prednisone, joint pains, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis, dmard, rheumatologist, rheumatoid, pains, "

1483, Consultation - an 87-year-old white female with weakness and a history of polymyositis., Rheumatology, Consult - Weankness & Polymyositis ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:, Regarding weakness and a history of polymyositis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, The patient is an 87-year-old white female who gives a history of polymyositis diagnosed in 1993. The patient did have biopsy of the quadriceps muscle performed at that time which, per her account, did show an abnormality. She was previously followed by Dr. C, neurology, over several years but was last followed up in the last three to four years. She is also seeing Dr. R at rheumatology in the past. Initially, she was treated with steroids but apparently was intolerant of that. She was given other therapy but she is unclear of the details of that. She has had persistent weakness of the bilateral lower extremities and has ambulated with the assistance of a walker for many years. She has also had a history of spine disease though the process there is not known to me at this time.,She presented on February 1, 2006 with productive cough, fevers and chills, left flank rash and pain there as well as profound weakness. Since admission, she has been diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonic process as well as shingles and is on therapy for both. She reports that strength in the proximal upper extremities has remained good. However, she has no grip strength. Apparently, this has been progressive over the last several years as well. She also presently has virtually no strength in the lower extremities and that is worse within the last few days. Prior to admission, she has had cough with mild shortness of breath. Phlegm has been dark in color. She has had reflux and occasional dysphagia. She has also had constipation but no other GI issues. She has no history of seizure or stroke like symptoms. She occasionally has headaches. No vision changes. Other than the left flank skin changes, she has had no other skin issues. She does have a history of DVT but this was 30 to 40 years ago. No history of dry eyes or dry mouth. She denies chest pain at present.,PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:, Hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of DVT, previous colonoscopy that was normal, renal artery stenosis.,MEDICATIONS:, Medications prior to admission: Os-Cal, Zyrtec, potassium, Plavix, Bumex, Diovan.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:, Acyclovir, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, Diovan, albuterol, Robitussin, hydralazine, Atrovent.,ALLERGIES:, NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, She is a widow. She has 8 children that are healthy with the exception of one who has coronary artery disease and has had bypass. She also has a son with lumbar spine disease. No tobacco, alcohol or IV drug abuse.,FAMILY HISTORY:, No history of neurologic or rheumatologic issues.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, As above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: She is afebrile.

No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES: No edema.,SKIN: Left flank dermatome with vesicular rash that is red and raised consistent with zoster.,JOINTS: No synovitis anywhere. Strength is 5/5 in the proximal upper extremities. Proximal lower extremities are 0 out of 5. She has no grip strength at present.,NEUROLOGICAL: Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact. Reflexes 2/4 at the biceps, brachial radialis, triceps. Nil out of four at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. Sensation seems normal. Chest x-ray shows COPD, left basilar infiltrate, cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic changes.,LABORATORY DATA:, White blood cell count 6.1, hemoglobin 11.9, platelets 314,000. Sed rate 29 and 30. Electrolytes: Sodium 134, potassium 4.9, creatinine 1.2, normal liver enzymes. TSH is slightly elevated at 5.38. CPK 36, BNP 645. Troponin less than 0.04.,IMPRESSION:,1. The patient has a history of polymyositis, apparently biopsy proven with a long standing history of bilateral lower extremity weakness. She has experienced dramatic worsening in the last 24 hours of the lower extremity weakness. This in the setting of an acute illness, presumably a pneumonic process.,2. She also gives a history of spine disease though the details of that process are not available either.,The question raised at this time is of recurrence in inflammatory myopathy which would need to include not only polymyositis but also inclusion body myositis versus progressive spine disease versus weakness secondary to acute illness versus neuropathic process versus other.,3. Zoster of the left flank.,4. Left lower lobe pneumonic process.,5. Elevation of the thyroid stimulating hormone.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. I have asked Dr. C to see the patient and he has done so tonight. He is planning for EMG nerve conduction study in the morning.,2. I would consider further spine evaluation pending review of the EMG nerve conduction study.,3. Agree with supportive care being administered thus far and will follow along with you.",

Lower extremities:  He still has some weakness of the knees, hip areas, and the calf muscles.  He does have minus/plus swelling of the right knee with a very hypermobile patella.  There is no limitation in his range of motion, and the swelling is very minimal with some mild tenderness.,In terms of his laboratories, they were not done today.,ASSESSMENT: , This is a 17-year-old male with oligoarticular arthritis.  He is HLA-B27 negative.,PLAN:,  In terms of the plan, I discussed with him what things he should be taking and the fact that since he has persistent symptoms, he should be on medication every day.  I am going to switch him to Indocin 75 mg SR just to give more sustained effect to his joints, and if he does not respond to this or continue with the symptoms, we may need to get an MRI.  We will see him back in three months.  He was evaluated by our physical therapist, who gave him some recommendations in terms of exercise for his lower extremities.  Future plans for A may include physical therapy and more stronger medications as well as imaging studies with an MRI.  Today he received his flu shot.  Discussed this with A and his aunt and they had no further questions.","rheumatology, rheumatology clinic, lower extremities, oligoarticular arthritis, arthritis, oligoarticular, knee, swelling,"
