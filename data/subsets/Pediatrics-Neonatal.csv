1887, Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.  The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis., Pediatrics - Neonatal, Thyroid Mass Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Current and up to date.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known drug allergies.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  ,Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.,FAMILY HISTORY: , There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.,HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.,NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.,CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.,ABDOMEN:  Benign.,EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.,GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.,SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.,NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: , I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.",

1890, The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis., Pediatrics - Neonatal, Supraventricular Tachycardia - Consult ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented today with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis.  The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.,HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.  She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation.  She had full symmetrical pulses.,HEART:  There is normoactive precordium without a thrill.  There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.,X-RAYS:,  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.,RECOMMENDATION: , My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.","pediatrics - neonatal, congenital heart disease, cyanotic, ductal-dependent, pulmonary blood flow, ventricular septal defect, blood flow, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, ventricular, supraventricular, shunt, heart, pulmonary,"

Low flow perfusion 32 minutes.,FINDINGS:,  Horizontal pulmonary venous confluence with right upper and middle with two veins entering the confluence on the right and multiple entry sites for left-sided veins.  Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.","pediatrics - neonatal, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, patent ductus arteriosus, ligation, secundum type atrial septal defect, atrial septal defect, subtotal thymectomy, peritoneal dialysis catheter, cross clamp, cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary venous, atrial septal, septal defect, anomalous, venous, atrial, arteriosus, patent, ductus, septal, aorta, pulmonary, "

As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.  The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care.  ,Sincerely,","pediatrics - neonatal, gestation, bronchodilator, childhood, childhood asthma, cough, father, healthy, letter, mother, pediatric, prematurity, shortness of breath, sister, wheezing, wheezing cough, asthma, "

I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,","pediatrics - neonatal, differential function, diuretic renal scan, abdominal pain, renal scan, pediatric urology, "

His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.,PHYSICAL FINDINGS,GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.,VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.,SKIN:  He was pink.,He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.,His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.,IMPRESSION: , My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.,Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.","pediatrics - neonatal, high-frequency ventilator, structural anatomy, foramen ovale, oxygen requirement, hypertension, pulmonary "

The left chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a posterolateral thoracotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the second intercostal space was entered freely with no damage to the underlying lung parenchyma.  The lung was quite edematous and was retracted anteriorly exposing the area of the isthmus.  The pleura overlying the ductus arteriosus was inside and the duct dissected in a nearly circumferential fashion.  It was then test occluded and then interrupted with a medium titanium clip.  There was preserved pulsatile flow in the descending aorta.  The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved.  With excellent hemostasis, the intercostal space was closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures and the muscular planes were reapproximated with 5-0 Caprosyn running suture in two layers.  The skin was closed with a running 6-0 Caprosyn suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was returned to the supine position in which palpable bilateral femoral pulses were noted.,I was the surgical attending present in the neonatal intensive care unit and in-charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.","pediatrics - neonatal, clip interruption, ligation, patent ductus arteriosus, premature baby, intercostal space, arteriosus, interruption, pulmonary, circulation"

He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.,LABORATORY FINDINGS: , He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.

Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.",

The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  Blood loss was minimal.  No specimen was submitted.,","pediatrics - neonatal, hydrocele, hydrocele repair, hernia, inguinal, fluid collection, tunica vaginalis, peritesticular space, hydrocele sac, spermatic cord, cord structures, inguinal hernia, communicating hydrocele, fluid, vaginalis"

Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.,The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.,The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.,IMPRESSION: , The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.,PLAN:  ,The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.","pediatrics - neonatal, decannulation, enteral feeding, feeding access, laparoscopic fundoplication, gastrostomy, airway, laryngotracheoplasty, laparoscopic, fundoplication, "

Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.,FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: , Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.,NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: , Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.

A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.,ASSESSMENT: , The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.,CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. , Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.,PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.,  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.,GERD.,  The history of ""heartburn"" relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.,PLAN:,  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.",

The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.","pediatrics - neonatal, lumbar osteomyelitis, central intravenous access, subclavian, osteomyelitis, broviac catheter, catheter, toddler, intravenous,"
