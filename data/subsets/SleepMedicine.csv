1460, Chronic snoring in children, Sleep Medicine, Snoring ,"CHRONIC SNORING,Chronic snoring in children can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea or upper airway resistant syndrome.  Both conditions may lead to sleep fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the cardiovascular system.  Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue, hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school performance have been reported with these conditions.  In addition, the most severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.,In this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity and the tonsillar hypertrophy.  It is therefore indicated and medically necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation.  A two week sleep diary will be given to the parents to fill out daily before the polysomnogram is performed.","sleep medicine, snoring, chronic snoring, behavior difficulty, fatigue, hyperactivity, obstructive sleep apnea, oxygen, oxygen desaturation, polysomnogram, poor sleep quality, right ventricular hypertrophy, school performance, sleep fragmentation, somnolence, systemic hypertension, upper airway, upper airway resistant syndrome, snoring chronic, hypertrophy, sleepNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

At that time, she was evaluated and found to have evidence for sleep disruption and daytime fatigue.  She also complained of nocturnal choking episodes that have since abated over the past several months.  In the meantime, she had been scheduled for an overnight sleep study performed to evaluate her for sleep apnea, returns today to review her study results.,The patient's sleep patterns consist of going to bed between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. and awakening in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 a.m.  She reports difficulty in initiating sleep and then recurrent awakenings every 1 to 2 hours throughout the night.  She reports tossing and turning throughout the night and awakening with the sheets in disarray.  She reports that her sleep was much better quality in the sleep laboratory as compared to home.  When she awakens, she might have a dull headache and feels tired in the morning.  Her daughter reports that she has heard the patient talking during sleep and snoring.  There are no apneic episodes.  The patient reports that she used to cough a lot in the middle of the night, but has no longer been doing so in recent weeks.,During the daytime, the patient reports spending a lot of sedentary time reading and watching TV.  She routinely dozes off during these sedentary activities.  She also might nap between 2.00 and 3.00 p.m., and nods off in the evening hours.,The patient smokes perhaps one to two packs of cigarettes per day, particularly after dinner.,She reports that her weight has fluctuated and peaked at 260 pounds approximately 1 year ago.

Neurologic:  Grossly nonfocal.,LABORATORIES:,  Pulmonary function studies reportedly show a mild restrictive ventilatory defect without obstruction.  Diffusing capacity is well preserved.,An overnight sleep study was performed on this patient at the end of 02/07.  At that time, she reported that her sleep was better in the laboratories compared to home.  She slept for a total sleep time of 398 minutes out of 432 minutes in bed (sleep proficiency 92 percent).  She fell asleep in the middle of latency of less than 1 minute.  She woke up after sleep onset of 34 minutes.  She had stage I sleep that was some elevated at 28 percent of total sleep time, and stage I sleep is predominantly evident in the lateral portion of the night.  The remainders were stage II at 69 percent, stage III and IV at 3 percent of total sleep time.,The patient had no REM sleep.,The patient had no periodic limb movements during sleep.,The patient had no significant sleep-disordered breathing during non-REM sleep with less than one episode per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturation remained in the low to mid 90s throughout the night.,Intermittent inspiratory flow limitation compatible with snoring was observed during non-REM sleep.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This patient presents with history of sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness with fatigue.  Her symptoms are multifactorial.,Regarding the etiology of difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, the patient has a component of psychophysiologic insomnia, based on reports of better sleep in the laboratory as compared to home.  In addition, nontrivial smoking in the home setting may be contributing significantly to sleep disruption.,Regarding her daytime sleepiness, the patient is taking a number of long-acting central nervous system acting medications to sedate her and can produce a lasting sedation throughout the daytime.  These include trazodone, Seroquel, and methadone.  Of these medications, the methadone is clearly indicative, given the history of substance abuse.  It would be desirable to reduce or discontinue trazodone and then perhaps consider doing the same with Seroquel.  I brought this possibility up with the patient, and I asked her to discuss this further with her psychiatrist.,Finally, to help mitigate sleep disruption at night, I have provided her with tips for sleep hygiene.  These include bedtime rituals, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction as well as avoidance of nicotine in the evening hours.",
1462, The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram., Sleep Medicine, Overnight Polysomnogram ,"The patient underwent an overnight polysomnogram on 09/22/06 and the details of the polysomnographic study are reported separately.  The highlights of the study include the following:,A.  Obstructive apneas and hypopneas were identified with an overall apnea-hypopnea index of 15.2 events per hour in the supine position.  All events occurred in the supine position and were more prominent during stage REM sleep.  Minimum oxygen saturation was 88%.,B.  Periodic limb movements in sleep were identified with an overall index of 32 events per hour of sleep.,C.  The patient's sleep efficiency was reduced to 89.2%.  There was significant sleep fragmentation due to the obstructive apneas and hypopneas as well as due to the periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  The patient did not achieve any stage III/IV sleep and stage REM sleep was diminished at 12.7%.  There was a corresponding increase in stage I sleep and stage II sleep at 10.8% and 65.7% respectively.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,1.  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, supine position dependent, moderate (780.53-0).,2.  Periodic limb movement in sleep disorder, moderate (780.53-4).,CASE DISCUSSION: , Thank you once again for allowing us to participate in the care of the patient here at the Sleep Clinic.,The patient exhibits obstructive sleep apnea, a condition associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death.  Furthermore, patients with this condition are susceptible to excessive daytime sleepiness while driving and there is a higher incidence of automobile accident.  The patient should be warned with regards to these possibilities.,Patients with this condition can be successfully treated with nasal CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), so that the patient should return to the sleep laboratory for repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration.  The sleep laboratory if necessary can introduce the patient to the proper use of the CPAP equipment and to determine a necessary pressure to prevent apneas.,It is reported that the patient undergo careful ENT/maxillofacial evaluation by a physician familiar with sleep disorders.  Anatomical abnormalities in the upper airway often cause or predispose to this condition.  Surgical intervention may be helpful or necessary if such conditions exist.  Alternatively, ________ may be of benefit in some patients depending upon the anatomical abnormalities.,Obstructive sleep apnea is worsened by obesity.  The patient should be encouraged to lose weight.  Patients usually lose weight more effectively when involved in a behavioral weight loss program.  It is sometimes difficult for patients to lose weight until the OSA is adequately treated because excessive daytime sleepiness results in decreased physical activity in the daytime.,Patient may have worsening obstructive sleep apnea by nasal airway obstruction and nasal congestion.  If present, these conditions should be treated.  In addition, any home allergens such as pets, down bedding or other factors should be removed from the sleep environment.,The patient should be informed that obstructive sleep apnea may be worsened by the use of alcohol or sedative medications particularly taken in the evening.  Therefore, the evening use of sedative medications and alcohol are to be avoided.,The patient also exhibits periodic limb movements in sleep disorder.  This may require treatment.  However, it will be appropriate to obtain the repeat overnight polysomnogram with CPAP titration to see if the PLMS continues to be troublesome.  If so, treatment recommendations will be made.","sleep medicine, periodic limb movement, cpap, limb movements in sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, overnight polysomnogram, sleep, overnight, polysomnogram, obstructive, apneas,"

She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has ""terrible quality sleep."",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.  I have also asked her to add Lasix in additional late afternoon to evening dose of Lasix at 40 mg by mouth at that time.  She was instructed to take between one and two K-Tab with her evening dose of Lasix (10 to 20 mEq).,In addition, we will obtain a complete set of pulmonary function studies to evaluate this patient for underlying causes of parenchymal lung disease that may interfere with oxygenation.  Further workup for hypoxemia may include high-resolution CT scanning if evidence for significant pulmonary restriction and/or reductions in diffusion capacity is evident on pulmonary function testing.","sleep medicine, polyarteritis nodosa, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary function, obesity hypoventilation, mononeuritis multiplex, sleep apnea, sleep study, rem sleep, ativan, sleep, hypoventilation, obesity, "

He states he wakens up during the night, usually goes to bed at 10 to 11, gets up at 7 to 7:30.  In the weekends, he stays up late and sleeps until 1 in the afternoon.  He lists sporadic use of melatonin and Benadryl, and Tylenol PM for sleep.  His other medicines are Accutane, Nasonex and oxymetazoline.  There is no smoking, no alcohol intake.  He does have three caffeinated beverages a week.  He is 75 inches, 185 pounds, BMI 23.1.  He rated himself 4/7 on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale at the onset of the study and 6 on the Epworth Sleeping Scale, said that his night sleep in the lab was characterized by a longer than usual sleep onset latency with more arousals than usual.  He woke up feeling equally rested and the only comment he made on the post sleep questionnaire was ""some of the wires"" is the source of problems.,TECHNIQUE: , The study was performed with the following parameters measured throughout the entirety of the recording:,Electroencephalogram, electromyogram of the chin and lower extremities, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, air flow from the nose and mouth, respiratory effort at the chest and abdomen, and finger oximetry.,The record was scored for sleep and the various other parameters in 30-second epochs.,RESULTS: , This study was performed in 61 minutes in duration during which he slept 432 minutes after 19 minutes sleep onset latency; thereafter, he had 10 awakenings for 6 minutes of wakefulness giving him a normal sleep efficiency of 95%.  Sleep staging was actually fairly deep and normal for age with 5% stage I, 51% stage II, 22% slow wave sleep and 22% REM.  He had 5 REM periods during the night.  The first beginning 66 minutes after sleep onset.  He did have 63 arousals, giving him a borderline elevated arousal index of 8.8, 16 were driven by limb movements, 41 of unclear origin, 6 from hypopneas.,EEG PARAMETERS: , No abnormalities.,EKG PARAMETERS: , Normal sinus rhythm, mean rate 76, no ectopics noted.,EMG PARAMETERS: , 88 PLMs were noted.  There was fairly small excursion with a movement index of 12, only 16 led to arousals with a movement arousal index of 2.2, not considered as a significant feature for sleep fragmentation.,RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS:,  Breathing rate in the high teens, reaching as high as 20 in REM.  There was really no snoring noted.  He slept in all positions and during the night had 9 respiratory events, one was a postarousal central event, the other eight were obstructive hypopneas mean duration 26 seconds, little worse in the supine position where his AHI was 4.7, but overall his AHI was 1.3.  This is only a marginal abnormality and is well below the threshold for CPAP intervention.,IMPRESSION:,  Largely normal polysomnogram demonstrating very modest obstructive sleep apnea in the supine position and a very modest periodic limb movement disturbance.","sleep medicine, sleep, sleep difficulties, mouth breather, epworth sleeping scale, stanford sleepiness scale, sleep onset latency, arousals, electroencephalogram, electromyogram, electrooculogram, electrocardiogram, polysomnogram, sleep apnea, periodic limb movement, hypopneas, accutane,"

This is an 18-channel recording obtained using the standard scalp and referential electrodes observing the 10/20 international system., Sleep Medicine, Electroencephalogram - 2 ,"REPORT:  ,This is an 18-channel recording obtained using the standard scalp and referential electrodes observing the 10/20 international system.  The patient was reported to be cooperative and was awake throughout the recording.,CLINICAL NOTE:  ,This is a 51-year-old male, who is being evaluated for dizziness.  Spontaneous activity is fairly well organized, characterized by low-to-medium voltage waves of about 8 to 9 Hz seen mainly from the posterior head region.  Intermixed with it is a moderate amount of low voltage fast activity seen from the anterior head region.,Eye opening caused a bilateral symmetrical block on the first run.  In addition to the above description, movement of muscle and other artifacts are seen.,On subsequent run, no additional findings were seen.,During subsequent run, again no additional findings were seen.,Hyperventilation was omitted.,Photic stimulation was performed, but no clear-cut photic driving was seen.,EKG was monitored during this recording and it showed normal sinus rhythm when monitored.,IMPRESSION:  ,This record is essentially within normal limits.

1471, Electroencephalographic findings and interpretation, Sleep Medicine, Electroencephalography ,"HISTORY:, This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures.,BACKGROUND ACTIVITY:, The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region.,ACTIVATION PROCEDURES:, Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality.,SLEEP PATTERNS:, No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing.,IMPRESSION:, This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended.","sleep medicine, electroencephalography, eeg, hz rhythm, parkinson's tremor, photic stimulation, frontal head region, temporal head region, muscle contractions, seizures, parkinson's, temporal, "
