2373," Vitrectomy. A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  ", Ophthalmology, Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.  The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition.","ophthalmology, conjunctival peritomy, westcott scissors, lid speculum, inferotemporal quadrants, inferotemporal, conjunctival, scissors, supranasal, supratemporal, sclerotomy, eye, vitreous, vitrectomy, infusion, cannulaNOTE"

She has no exposure to tuberculosis or syphilis, she has no mouth or genital ulcers.  She has no skin rashes.  She has no connective tissue disorders.,PAST OCULAR HISTORY: , Significant for cataract and glaucoma surgery of the right eye.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , On examination, visual acuity measures hand motions on the right and 20/25 in the left.  There is an afferent pupillary defect on the right.  On examination, there is a right hypertropia.  There is dense anterior chamber inflammation on the right eye with a stagnant aqueous.  There is either neovascularization on the iris or reactive iris vessels, it is difficult to discern.  This seems to be complete iris synechia to the anterior lens capsule.  There is a posterior chamber intraocular lens with an inflammatory debris on the anterior surface.  The anterior chamber appears narrow.  On the left, there is also dense inflammation at 4+ cell.  There is 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  Dilated fundus examination cannot be performed on the right secondary to intense inflammation.  On the left, there is no evidence of active posterior uveitis.  There is some inferior vitreous debris.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:,  Chronic bilateral recurrent nongranulomatous diffuse uveitis.  Currently, there is very severe right eye inflammation and severe left eye.  I discussed at length with the patient that this will likely take an oral steroid to quite her down.  Since she has only one seeing eye, I am anxious to obtain a decreased inflammation as soon as possible.  She has been on oral steroids in the past.  We also discussed, considering the aggressive recurrent nature of this process, it is likely we will have to consider a steroid sparing agent to maintain longer term control of this recurrent process so that we do not use visual acuity in the left.  I anticipate we will likely start methotrexate in the near future.  In this acute phase, I have recommended oral steroids at a dose of 60 mg a day, hourly topical Pred Forte as well as atropine sulfate.  We will watch her closely in clinic.  I am sending a copy of this dictation to her primary care doctor, she said she has had a negative HLA-B27, rheumatoid factor, and ANA in the past.  At this stage, to be thorough I would ask Dr. X to assist us in repeating her chest x-ray, PPD if not current, and an RPR.  Additionally, in anticipation of need for methotrexate, it would be helpful to have a full liver function profile as well as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.","ophthalmology, iritis, nongranulomatous, uveitis, eye inflammation, photophobia, recurrent nongranulomatous anterior iritis, headache and photophobia, anterior chamber, anterior, chamber, inflammation, "

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber.

The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

The posterior capsule remained intact and vacuumed with minimal suction.  The posterior chamber intraocular lens was obtained.  It was inspected, irrigated, inserted into the posterior chamber without difficulty.  Inspection revealed the intraocular lens to be in good position with intact capsule and well-approximated wound.  There was no aqueous leak even with digital pressure.  The conjunctiva was pulled back into position with wet-field cautery.  A subconjunctival injection with 20 mg Gatamycine and 0.5 cc Celestone was given.  Tobradex ointment was instilled into the eye, which was patched and shielded appropriately, after removing the lid speculum and bridle suture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition, to be followed in attending physician office the next day.","ophthalmology, extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification, nuclear sclerotic, cortical cataract, extraction with intraocular lens, cataract extraction, intraocular lens, intraocular, extracapsular, implantation, conjunctival, cataract, chamberNOTE"

There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  The cataract was believed related to her decline in vision.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including with observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The risks as explained included, but are not limited to pain, bleeding, infection, decreased or loss of vision/loss of eye, retinal detachment requiring further surgery, and possible consultation out of town, swelling of the back part of the eye/retina, need for prolonged eye drop use or injections, instability of the lens, and loss of corneal clarity necessitating long-term drop use or further surgery.  The possibility of needing intraocular lens exchange or incorrect lens power was discussed.  Anesthesia option and risks associated with anesthesia and retrobulbar anesthesia were discussed.  It was explained that some or all of these complications might arise at the time of or months to years after surgery.  The patient had a good understanding of the risks with the proposed, elective eye surgery.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was signed and placed in the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After intravenous sedation, the retrobulbar block was injected followed by several minutes of digital massage.  No signs of orbital tenseness or retrobulbar hemorrhage were present.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  An eyelid speculum was used to separate the eyelids.  A crescent blade was used to make a clear corneal temporally located incision.  A 1-mm Dual-Bevel blade was used to make a paracentesis site.  The anterior chamber was filled with viscoelastic (Viscoat).  The crescent blade was then used to make an approximate 2-mm long clear corneal tunnel through the temporal incision.  A 2.85-mm keratome blade was then used to penetrate into the anterior chamber through the temporal tunneled incision.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsulorrhexis was completed with the Utrata forceps.  A 27-guage needle was used for hydrodissection and three full and complete fluid waves were noted.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer ultrasound was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove all remaining cortex.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  An AMO model SI40NB posterior chamber intraocular lens with power *** diopters and serial number *** was injected into the capsular bag.  The trailing haptic was placed with the Sinskey hook.  The lens was made well centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and eccentric posterior chamber intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Vigamox and Econopred drops were applied.  A soft eye patch followed by a firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.  The patient was comfortable and was discharged with followup in 24 hours.

All of their questions were answered.  Informed consent was signed.  The patient was brought into the operating room.  A surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  After administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,The right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  A 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with Supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with Healon.  The clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  A 7-0 Vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  A microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  The presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  Two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,The vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  The pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the BIOM non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  The vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  A posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,The foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  The exit wound was explored.  No intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  The intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,An air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  No retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  The plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  Each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #XXX band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the Watzke sleeve.  The buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 Mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  The buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,Residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  A 12% concentration of C3F8 gas was flushed through the eye.  The infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 Vicryl suture.  All of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.  The intraocular pressure following injection of 0.05 mL each of vancomycin (0.5 mg) and ceftazidime (1 mg) were injected through the superotemporal pars plana, 30-gauge needles.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut sutures with the knots buried.  Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and Decadron were delivered inferotemporally.  The lid speculum was removed.  Pred-G ointment and atropine solution were applied to the ocular surface.  The eye was patched and shielded, and the patient was returned to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.

She is an 87-year-old woman with a history of macular degeneration, who admits to having PDT therapy within the last year.  She would like to get started with some vision therapy so that she may be able to perform her everyday household chores, as well as reading small print.  At this time, she uses a small handheld magnifier, which is providing her with only limited help.,A complete refractive work-up was performed today, in which we found a mild change in her distance correction, which allowed her the ability to see 20/70 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye.  With a pair of +4 reading glasses, she was able to read 0.5M print quite nicely.  I have loaned her a pair of +4 reading glasses at this time and we have started her with fine-detailed reading.  She will return to our office in a matter of two weeks and we will make a better determination on what near reading glasses to prescribe for her.

Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.  I have recommended him to follow up with you for continued examination, continued check-ups, and should you find any other abnormal findings, I would be happy to address those again.,Again, thank you for your referral of Mr. ABC.,Sincerely,,","ophthalmology, cup to disc ratio, referred for evaluation, cup to disc, disc ratio, macula vessels, pressures, eye, macula, vessels, visual, cup, disc, glaucoma, examination, intact, "

I examined Mrs. ABC initially on MM/DD/YYYY.  At that time, she expressed a chief concern of occasional pain around her eye, but denied any flashing lights, floaters, halos, or true brow ache.  She reports a family history of glaucoma in her mother, but is unsure of the specific kind.  Her past ocular history has been fairly unremarkable.  As you know, she has a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes.  She is unaware of her last hemoglobin A1c levels, but reports a blood sugar of 158 taken on the morning of her appointment with me.  She is followed by Dr. X here locally.,Upon examination, her visual acuity measured 20/20-1 in either eye with her glasses.  Presenting intraocular pressures were14 mmHg in either eye at 2:03 p.m.  Pupillary reactions, confrontational visual fields, and ocular motility were normal.  The slit lamp exam revealed narrow anterior chambers and on gonioscopy only the buried anterior trabecular meshwork was visible in either eye, but the angle deepened with gonio-compression suggesting appositional and not synechial closure.  I deferred the dilated portion of the exam on that day.,We proceeded with peripheral iridectomies and following this upon her most recent visit on MM/DD/YYYY, I was able to safely dilate her eyes as her chambers had deepened and the PIs were patent.  I note that she has an increased CD ratio measuring 0.65 in the right eye and 0.7 in the left and although her FDT visual fields and GDX testing were normal at your office, she does have an enlarged blind spot in either eye on Humphrey visual fields and retinal tomography also shows some suspicious changes.  Therefore, I feel she has sustained some optic nerve damage perhaps from intermittent angle closure in the past.,In summary, Mrs. ABC has a history of narrow angles not successfully treated with laser PIs.  Her intraocular pressures have remained stable.  I will continue to monitor her closely.,Thank you very much once again for allowing me to have shared in her care.  If I can provide any additional information or be of further service, do let me know.,Sincerely,,","ophthalmology, intraocular pressures, narrow angles, visual fields, angles, intraocular, pressures, anterior, chambers, gonioscopy, glaucoma, narrow, visual, eye, "

A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team., Ophthalmology, Intraocular Lens Implant ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:  ,1.  Secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant with penetrating keratoplasty.,2.  A concurrent vitrectomy and endolaser was performed by the vitreoretinal team.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY:  ,The patient is a 62-year-old white male who underwent cataract surgery in 09/06.  This was complicated by posterior capsule rupture.  An intraocular lens implant was not attempted.  He developed corneal edema and a preretinal hemorrhage.  He is aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery and now wishes to proceed with secondary scleral suture fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens implant in the left eye, vitrectomy, endolaser, and penetrating keratoplasty.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.

The patient's cornea sent to Eye Pathology.,PROS DEV IMPLANT:  ,ABC Laboratories 16.0 diopter posterior chamber intraocular lens, serial number 123456.,NARRATIVE: , Informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered.  The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.  No qualified resident was available to assist.","ophthalmology, vitrectomy, endolaser, keratoplasty, intraocular lens implant, preretinal hemorrhage, scleral flaps, intraocular, keratoprosthesis, chamber, implant, scleral, vitreoretinal, lens, sutures, eye, "

Conservative measures at home have failed to completely resolve the symptoms.  He has been placed on previous antibiotics treatment for presumed conjunctivitis.  Please refer to clinic note for more details.  Conservative measures at home have failed to resolve the symptoms.  A nasolacrimal probing was offered as an elective procedure.  Procedure as well as inherent risks, expected outcomes, benefits, and alternatives (including continued observation) were discussed with his mother prior to scheduling surgery.  Again, a description of procedure as well as diagram instruction was provided to mother and father in the morning of the procedure.  The risks as explained included, but were not limited to temporary bleeding, persistent symptoms, recurrence need for further procedure, possible need for future stent placement or repeat probing, and anesthesia risk were all discussed.  Also a rare possibility of errant passage of the nasolacrimal probe was discussed.  Preoperative evaluation and explanation include drying of the nasolacrimal system with an explanation expected outcome/result from surgery.  No guarantees were offered.  Informed consent was signed and placed on the chart.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  Procedure as well as inherent risks were again discussed with parents prior to the procedure.  After anesthesia was induced in the operating room, tetracaine drops were applied to each eye and the pressure of the eyes were checked with Tono-Pen.  The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.  I did advised nasolacrimal massage for the next 7 to 10 days on each side two to three times daily.  Technique explained and demonstrated.  Erythromycin ointment to both eyes twice daily for three days.

The next day he woke up and he had double vision again. ", Ophthalmology, Diplopia ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia.  He states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in January 2009.  He had double vision.  He states when he closed each eye, the double vision dissipated.  The double vision entirely dissipated within one hour.  He was able to drive.  However, the next day he woke up and he had double vision again.  Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and frequency and by the second week, it was severe.  He states that he called Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for evaluation.  He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an ophthalmologic evaluation.  He was seen and referred to the emergency department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm.  The patient states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.,For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still experiences constant diplopia.  Whereas in the past, when he would see two objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much closer together.  He still does not drive.  He also is not working due to the double vision.  There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision.  More recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain.  It actually feels like there is pain under his right lid.  He denies any dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological symptoms.,There is a neurology consultation in the computer system.  Dr. X saw the patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department.  He underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the right side.  MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast was also negative.  He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast that was normal.  His impression was that the patient should follow up for a possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.,At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid ptosis.  He had left gaze diplopia.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.  According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil.  There was also right medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities.  I do not have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient denies any previous past medical history.

Simultaneous recordings were made in both eyes in the horizontal direction and the left eye in the vertical directions.  Caloric irrigations were performed using a closed loop irrigation system at 30 degrees and 44 degrees C into either ear.,FINDINGS: , Gaze testing did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.  Saccadic movements did not reveal any evidence of dysmetria or overshoot.  Sinusoidal tracking was performed well for the patient's age.  Optokinetic nystagmus testing was performed poorly due to the patient's difficulty in following the commands.  Therefore adequate OKNs were not achieved.  The Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the head handing left position resulted in moderate intensity left beating nystagmus, which was converted to a right beating nystagmus when she sat up again.  The patient complained of severe dizziness in this position.  There was no clear-cut decremental response with repetition.  In the head hanging left position, no significant nystagmus was identified.  Positional testing in the supine, head hanging, head right, head left, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus positions did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.,Caloric stimulation revealed a calculated unilateral weakness of 7.0% on the right (normal <20%) and left beating directional preponderance of 6.0% (normal <20-30%).,IMPRESSION: , Abnormal electronystagmogram demonstrating prominent nystagmus on position testing in the head hanging right position.

Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","ophthalmology, cosmetic surgery, jaeger lid plate, lacri-lube, q-tip, blepharoplasty, conjunctiva, facial asymmetry, fat pad, lower lid, midface lift, regional field block, temporal fascia, temporal fossa, vasoconstriction, true temporal fascia, gingivobuccal sulcus, gingivobuccal,"
2428, Clear corneal temporal incision (no stitches).  A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye., Ophthalmology, Clear Corneal Temporal Incision ,"CLEAR CORNEAL TEMPORAL INCISION (NO STITCHES),DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , Under satisfactory local anesthesia, the patient was appropriately prepped and draped.  A lid speculum was placed in the fissure of the right eye.,The secondary incision was then made through clear cornea using 1-mm diamond keratome at surgeon's 7:30 position and the anterior chamber re-formed using viscoelastic.

She also has a history of glaucoma diagnosed in 1990 and macular degeneration.  She has been followed in her home country and is here visiting family.  She had the above-mentioned observation and was brought in on an urgent basis today.,Her past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and hypothyroidism.,Her medications include V-optic 0.5% eye drops to both eyes twice a day and pilocarpine 2% OU three times a day.  She took both the drops this morning.  She also takes Eltroxin which is for hypothyroidism, Plendil for blood pressure, and pravastatin.,She is allergic to Cosopt.,She has a family history of blindness in her brother as well as glaucoma and hypertension.,Her visual acuity today at distance without correction are 20/25 in the right and count fingers at 3 feet in the left eye.  Manifest refraction showed no improvement in either eye.  The intraocular pressures by applanation were 7 on the right and 18 in the left eye.  Gonioscopy showed grade 4 open angles in both eyes.  Humphrey visual field testing done elsewhere showed diffuse reduction in sensitivity in both eyes.  The lids were normal OU.  She has mild dry eye OU.  The corneas are clear OU.  The anterior chamber is deep and quiet OU.  Irides appear normal.  The lenses show well centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses OU.,Dilated fundus exam shows clear vitreous OU.  The optic nerves are normal in size.  They both appear to have mild pallor.  The optic cups in both eyes are shallow.  The cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye is not overtly large, would estimated 0.5 to 0.6; however, she does have very thin rim tissue inferotemporally in the right eye.  In the left eye, the glaucoma appears to be more advanced to the larger cup-to-disc ratio and a thinner rim tissue.,The macula on the right shows drusen with focal areas of RPE atrophy.  I do not see any evidence of neovascularization such as subretinal fluid, lipid or hemorrhage.  She does have a punctate area of RPE atrophy which is just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  In the left eye, she has also several high-risk drusen, but no evidence of neovascularization.  The RPE in the left eye does appear to be more diffusely abnormal although these changes do appear somewhat mild.  I do not see any dense or focal areas of frank RPE atrophy or hypertrophy.,The peripheral retinas are attached in both eyes.,Ms. ABC has pseudophakia OU which is stable and she is doing well in this regard.  She has glaucoma which likely is worse in the left eye and also likely explains her poor vision in the left eye.  The intraocular pressure in the mid-to-high teens in the left eye is probably high for her.  She has allergic reaction to Cosopt.  I will recommend starting Xalatan OS nightly.  I think the intraocular pressure in the right eye is acceptable and is probably a stable pressure for her OD.  She will need followup in the next 1 or 2 months after returning home to Israel later this week after starting the new medication which is Xalatan.,Regarding the macular degeneration, she has had high-risk changes in both eyes.  The vision in the right eye is good, but she does have a very concerning area of RPE atrophy just adjacent to the fovea of the right eye.  I strongly recommend that she see a retina specialist before returning to Israel in order to fully discuss prophylactic measures to prevent worsening of her macular degeneration in the right eye.","ophthalmology, cataract extraction, lens implants, decreased vision, macular degeneration, intraocular pressures, rpe atrophy, eye, degeneration, glaucoma, macular, vision, "

He was anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen was sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.

2437, A sample note on Cataract, Ophthalmology, Cataract ,"CATARACT, is the loss of transparency of the lens of the eye.  It often appears like a window that is fogged with steam.,WHAT CAUSES CATARACT FORMATION?,*  Aging, the most common cause.,*  Family history.,*  Steroid use.,*  Injury to the eye.,*  Diabetes.,*  Previous eye surgery.,*  Long-term exposure to sunlight.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE A CATARACT?,*  The best way for early detection is regular eye examinations by your medical eye doctor. There are many causes of visual loss in addition to the cataract such as problems involving the optic nerve and retina.  If these other problems exist, cataract removal may not result in the return or improvement of vision.  Your eye doctor can tell you how much improvement in vision is likely.,DOES IT TAKE A LONG TIME FOR A CATARACT TO FORM?,Cataract development varies greatly between patients and is affected by the cause of the cataract.  Generally, cataracts progress gradually over many years.  Some people, especially diabetics and younger patients, may find that cataract formation progresses rapidly over a few months making it impossible to know exactly how long it will take for the cataract to develop. ,WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR CATARACTS?,The only way to remove a cataract is surgery.  If the symptoms are not restricting your activity, a change of glasses may alleviate the symptoms at this time.  No medications, exercise, optical devices or dietary supplements have been shown to stop the progression or prevent cataracts.,It is important to provide protection from excessive sunlight.  Making sure that the sunglasses you wear screen out ultraviolet (UV) light rays or your regular eyeglasses are coated with a clear, anti-UV coating will help prevent or slow the progression of cataracts.,HOW DO I KNOW IF I NEED SURGERY?,Surgery is considered when your vision is interfering with your daily activities.  It is important to evaluate if you can see to do your job and drive safely.  Can you read and watch TV in comfort? Are you able to cook, do your shopping and yard work or take your medications without difficulty? Depending on how you feel your vision is affecting your daily life, you and your eye doctor will decide together when it is the appropriate time to do surgery.,WHAT IS INVOLVED WITH CATARACT SURGERY?,This surgery is generally performed under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis.  With the assistance of a microscope, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a permanent intraocular lens implant.,Right after the surgery you should be able to immediately perform all your normal activities except for the most strenuous ones.  You will need to take eye drops as directed by your eye doctor.  Follow-up visits are necessary to make sure the surgical site is healing without problems.,This procedure is performed on over 1.4 million people each year in the United States alone, 95% without complications.  With this highly successful procedure, 90% of the time vision improves unless a problem also exists with the cornea, retina or optic nerve.  As with any surgery, a good result cannot be guaranteed.","ophthalmology, transparency, eye, sunlight, optic nerve, eye doctor, cataract, retina, lens, vision, surgery, "

2442, The patient seeks evaluation for a second opinion concerning cataract extraction.  , Ophthalmology, Cataract - Second Opinion ,"SUBJECTIVE:  ,The patient seeks evaluation for a second opinion concerning cataract extraction.  She tells me cataract extraction has been recommended in each eye; however, she is nervous to have surgery.  Past ocular surgery history is significant for neurovascular age-related macular degeneration.  She states she has had laser four times to the macula on the right and two times to the left, she sees Dr. X for this.,OBJECTIVE: , On examination, visual acuity with correction measures 20/400 OU.  Manifest refraction does not improve this.  There is no afferent pupillary defect.  Visual fields are grossly full to hand motions.  Intraocular pressure measures 17 mm in each eye.  Slit-lamp examination is significant for clear corneas OU.  There is early nuclear sclerosis in both eyes.  There is a sheet like 1-2+ posterior subcapsular cataract on the left.  Dilated examination shows choroidal neovascularization with subretinal heme and blood in both eyes.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ,Advanced neurovascular age-related macular degeneration OU, this is ultimately visually limiting.  Cataracts are present in both eyes.  I doubt cataract removal will help increase visual acuity; however, I did discuss with the patient, especially in the left, cataract surgery will help Dr. X better visualize the macula for future laser treatment so that her current vision can be maintained.

Visual field testing showed *% superior hemifield loss on the right, and *% superior hemifield loss on the left.  These field losses resolved with upper eyelid taping which simulates the expected surgical correction.  Photodocumentation also showed the upper eyelids resting on the upper eyelashes, as well as a decrease in the effective superior marginal reflex distance.  The risks, benefits, limitations, alternatives, and expected improvement in symptoms and visual field loss were discussed in preoperative evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, On the day of surgery, the surgical site and procedure were verified by the physician with the patient.  An informed consent was signed and witnessed.  EMLA cream was applied to the eyelids and eyebrow region for 10 minutes to provide skin anesthesia.  Two drops of topical proparacaine eye drops were placed on the ocular surface.  The skin was cleaned with alcohol prep pads.  The patient received 3 to 4 mL of 2% Lidocaine with epinephrine and 0.5% Marcaine mixture to each upper lid.  5 to 6 mL of local were also given to the brow region along the entire length.  Pressure was applied over each site for 5 minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for oculoplastic surgery.,The desired amount of redundant brow tissue to be excised was carefully marked with a surgical marking pen on each side.  The contour of the outline was created to provide a greater temporal lift.  Care was taken to preserve a natural contour to the brow shape consistent with the patient’s desired features.  Using a #15 blade, the initial incision was placed just inside the superior most row of brow hairs, in parallel with the follicle growth orientation.  The incision extended in a nasal to temporal fashion with the nasal portion incision being carried down to muscle and becoming progressively shallower toward the tail of the incision line.  The dimensions of the redundant tissue measured * horizontally and * vertically.  The redundant tissue was removed sharply with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was maintained with hand held cautery and/or electrocautery.  The closure was carried out in multiple layers.  The deepest muscular/subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 transparent nylon in a horizontal mattress fashion.  The intermediate layer was closed with 5-0 Vicryl similarly.  The skin was closed with 6-0 nylon in a running lock fashion.  Iced saline gauze pads were placed over the incision sites.  This completed the brow repair portion of the case.,Using a surgical marking pen, a vertical line was drawn from the superior punctum to the eyebrow.  An angled line was drawn from the ala of the nares to the lateral canthus edge and extending to the tail of the brow.  These lines served as the relative boundary for the horizontal length of the blepharoplasty incision.  The desired amount of redundant tissue to be excised was carefully pinched together with 0.5 forceps.  This tissue was outlined with a surgical marking pen.  Care was taken to avoid excessive skin removal near the brow region.  A surgical ruler was used to ensure symmetry.  The skin and superficial orbicularis were incised with a #15 blade on the first upper lid.  This layer was removed with Westcott scissors.,Hemostasis was achieved with high-temp hand held pen cautery.  The remaining orbicularis and septum were grasped superiorly and inferiorly on each side of the incision and tented upward.  The high temp cautery pen was then used to incise these layers in a horizontal fashion until preapeuronotic fat was identified.  * amount of central preaponeurotic fat was removed with cautery.  * amount of nasal fat pad was removed in the same fashion.  Care was taken to not disturb the levator aponeurosis.  A symmetric amount of fat was removed from each side.  Iced gauze saline was placed over the site and the entire procedure repeated on the fellow eyelid.  Skin hooks were placed on either side of the incision and the skin was closed in a continuous running fashion with 6-0 nylon.  Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was placed over the incision site and on the ocular surface.  Saline gauze and cold packs were placed over the upper lids.  The patient was taken from the surgical suite in good condition.,DISCHARGE:,  In the recovery area the results of surgery were discussed with the patient and their family.  Specific instructions to resume all p.o. oral medications including anticoagulants/antiplatelets were given.  Written instructions and restrictions after eyelid surgery were reviewed with the patient and family member.  Instructions on antibiotic ointment use were reviewed.
