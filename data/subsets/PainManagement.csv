Interpretation of radiograph., Pain Management, Tun-L Catheter Placement ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Low Back Syndrome - Low back pain with left greater than right lower extremity radiculopathy.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Same.,PROCEDURE:,1.  Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.,2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.,3.  Interpretation of radiograph.,ANESTHESIA: , IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.,SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.,The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.,After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.","pain management, low back syndrome, low back pain, nerve root decompression, steroid solution, c-arm, epimed, tun l catheter, nerve root, negative aspiration, omnipaque dye, filling defect, nerve, root, catheter, adhesions, injection, needle,"

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.

1956, Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump and tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter., Pain Management, SynchroMed Pump Placement ,"PROCEDURES:,1.  Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.","pain management, intrathecal, catheter, paraspinous, cerebrospinal, synchromed infusion pump, synchromed pump catheter, synchromed pump, paraspinous muscle, cerebrospinal fluid, tunneling device, infusion pump, subcutaneous tissue, infusion, synchromed, pump, incision,"

Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.,Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.,TREATMENT PLAN:,  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.","pain management, progress note, management, muscle"

The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.,Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, an insulated 10-cm, 22-gauge needle with a 5-mm non-insulated stimulating tip was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique with PA views initially for orientation and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  For C3 to C6 medial branch RFTC's, the needles are placed along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch RFTC, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch RFTC, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.,Sensory stimulation was carried out at 50 Hz from 0 to 2.0 volts.  Stimulation was stopped once the maximum voltage was delivered or the patient either described a buzzing sensation indicating that it was a nonpainful nerve, or it caused replication of their concordant pain.  The stimulation was then changed to 2 Hz for motor stimulation and advanced up to 2.0 volts or until motor stimulation was found at that level.  If motor stimulation occurred, the needle was repositioned to abolish it but still cause concordant pain, or the RFTC was aborted at this level.,If the sensory stimulation caused concordant pain without motor stimulation, the area was then anesthetized with 1 cc of Marcaine 0.5% with 5 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate.  Once the anesthesia was established, a radiofrequency lesioning was then done at 65 degrees for 60 seconds.  The same procedure was carried out at all the affected levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any difficulties or complications.","pain management, rami, fluoroscopic control, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, cervical spondylosis, articular pillars, motor stimulation, medial branch, thermocoagulation, rftc, needle, cervical, stimulation"

Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.","pain management, sheath, vertebral body, regional pain syndrome, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, stellate ganglion, rftc, radiofrequency, radiograph, cricothyroid, thermocoagulation, ganglion,"

She is a long-term patient of mine at the Pain Management Clinic and has requested transference because of insurance reasons.  Today, she is here for not only establishment of care, but continued management of her many neck-related complaints.  Among these are spasms and ongoing pain for which she receives long-acting opioids.  She states that she is in fact doing quite well since her cervical fusion.  She is requesting that we decrease her medications from 480 mg to 240 mg to 360 mg of morphine per day in the form of Avinza.  She also is quite pleased with her other medication regimen which has been greatly simplified over the past year.,Other treatment modalities that have been helpful have included cervical epidural steroid injections.  The patient is requesting that we schedule this as well, as the relief provided by that lasted anywhere from four to six months.  I agree that because of intermittent radicular symptoms that this may be helpful particularly in light of her recent surgery.  She does complain of hand tingling and numbness, although she is not dropping objects or having difficulties with coordination.  I believe that in addition, the steroid injections may help expedite her desire to decrease her reliance on medications which have been oversedating as well as racked with other side effects.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: , Alcohol prep and sterile technique were used. A total of 6 cc of preservative-free 1% lidocaine was used and injected into eight different sites using a 25-gauge, 1-1/2-inch needle at the trapezius muscles bilaterally as well as the levator scapulae, the splenius capitis, and the semispinalis musculature.  The procedure was well tolerated.,TREATMENT PLAN:,1. The patient is tentatively scheduled for a cervical epidural steroid injection on March 14, 2005.,2. We will begin a weaning schedule for the patient's Avinza by decreasing in 60 mg intervals.  The patient will have a target of 120 mg p.o. b.i.d., and then be reassessed.  This is expected to occur after her cervical epidural steroid injection.",
