Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Hallux rigidus, left foot.,2.  Elevated first metatarsal, left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant.,2.  Screw fixation, left foot.,HISTORY: , This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time.  The patient desires surgical treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.,Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint.  Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule.  A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made.  Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx.  There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease.  There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal.  There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx.  A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail.  After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact.  The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp.  The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant.  A large was noted to be of the best size.  There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx.  Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base.  A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer.  The bone was noted to be significantly hardened.  The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant.  The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal.  The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process.  The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit.  There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant.,Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal.  A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created.  A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site.  The wedge was then removed in toto.  The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site.  The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position.  The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires.  A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion.  A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion.  With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites.,The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash.  A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl.  Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q.  4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain.  The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed.","surgery, hallux rigidus, metatarsal, youngswick, bunionectomy, screw fixation, ankle tourniquet, metatarsophalangeal joint, biopro implant, proximal phalanx, foot, austin, anesthesia, osteotomy, screw,"

179, Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot., Surgery, Youngswick Osteotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Youngswick osteotomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint of the right foot.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux limitus deformity of the right foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 10 mL.,HEMOSTASIS:,  Right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 35 minutes.,MATERIALS USED: , 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and two partially threaded cannulated screws from 3.0 OsteoMed System for internal fixation.,INJECTABLES:  ,Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical site.  The right ankle was then covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  The right foot was prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed just parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, all the capsular and periosteal attachments were mobilized from the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and head of the first right metatarsal.  Once the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe and the first right metatarsal head were adequately exposed, multiple osteophytes were encountered.  Gouty tophi were encountered both intraarticularly and periarticularly for the first right metatarsophalangeal joint, which were consistent with a medical history that is positive for gout for this patient.,Using sharp and dull dissection, all the ligamentous and soft tissue attachments were mobilized and the right first metatarsophalangeal joint was freed from all adhesions.  Using the sagittal saw, all the osteophytes were removed from the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the first right metatarsal head as well as the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Although some improvement of the range of motion was encountered after the removal of the osteophytes, some tightness and restriction was still present.  The decision was thus made to perform a Youngswick-type osteotomy on the head of the first right metatarsal.  The osteotomy consistent of two dorsal cuts and a plantar cut in a V-pattern with the apex of the osteotomy distal and the base of the osteotomy proximal.  The two dorsal cuts were longer than the plantar cut in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The wedge of bone that was formed between the two dorsal cuts was resected and passed off to Pathology for further examination.  The head of the first right metatarsal was then impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal and provisionally stabilized with two wires from the OsteoMed System.  The wires were inserted from a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction through the dorsal osteotomy.  The wires were also used as guidewires for the insertion of two 16-mm proximally threaded cannulated screws from the OsteoMed System.  The 2 screws were inserted using AO technique.  Upon insertion of the screws, the two wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy on the table was found to be excellent.  The area was copiously flushed with saline and range of motion was reevaluated and was found to be much improved from the preoperative levels without any significant restriction.  The cartilaginous surfaces on the base of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx were also fenestrated in order to induce some cartilaginous formation.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  Steri-Strips were used to approximate and reinforce the skin edges.  At this time, the right ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted in the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's surgical site was then covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and neurovascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery at home.  The patient was also given pain medication instructions on how to control her postoperative pain.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, hallux limitus deformity, metatarsophalangeal joint, plantar cut, youngswick osteotomy, dorsal cuts, ankle tourniquet, proximal phalanx, anesthesia, tourniquet, youngswick, phalanx, metatarsophalangeal, proximal, metatarsal, dorsal, osteotomy"

The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections the T11 compression fracture was identified.  Starting from the left side local anesthetic was used for skin wheal just lateral superior to the 10 o'clock position of the lateral aspect of the T11 pedicle on the left.  The 13-gauge needle and trocar were then taken and placed to 10 o'clock position on the pedicle.  At this point using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle and trocar were advanced into the vertebral body using the fluoroscopic images and making sure that the needle was lateral to the medial wall of the pedicle of the pedicle at all times.  Once the vertebral body was entered then using lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle was advanced to the junction of the anterior one third and posterior two thirds of the body.  At this point polymethylmethacrylate was mixed for 60 seconds.  Once the consistency had hardened and the __________ was gone, incremental dose of the cement were injected into the vertebral body.  It was immediately seen that the cement was going cephalad into the vertebral body and was exiting through the crack in the vertebra.  A total 1.2 cc of cement was injected.  On lateral view, the cement crushed to the right side as well.  There was some dye infiltration into the disk space.  There was no dye taken whatsoever into the posterior aspect of the epidural space or intrathecal canal.,At this point, as the needle was slowly withdrawn under lateral fluoroscopic images, visualization was maintained to ensure that none of the cement was withdrawn posteriorly into the epidural space.

", Surgery, Vitrectomy - 3 ,"DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.  Local anesthesia was obtained with a 50/50 mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.75% bupivacaine given as a peribulbar block.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A lid speculum was used to provide exposure to the right eye.,A limited conjunctival peritomy was created with Westcott scissors to expose the supranasal and, separately, the supratemporal and inferotemporal quadrants.  Calipers were set at 3.5 mm and a mark was made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.,A 5-0 nylon suture was passed through partial-thickness sclera on either side of this mark.  The MVR blade was used to make a sclerotomy between the pre-placed sutures.  An 8-0 nylon suture was then pre-placed for later sclerotomy closure.  The infusion cannula was inspected and found to be in good working order.  The infusion cannula was placed in the vitreous cavity and secured with the pre-placed sutures.  The tip of the infusion cannula was directly visualized and found to be free of any overlying tissue and the infusion was turned on.,Additional sclerotomies were made 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus in the supranasal and supratemporal quadrants.  The light pipe and vitrectomy handpieces were then placed in the vitreous cavity and a vitrectomy was performed.  There was moderately severe vitreous hemorrhage, which was removed.  Once a view of the posterior pole could be obtained, there were some diabetic membranes emanating along the arcades.  These were dissected with curved scissors and judicious use of the vitrectomy cutter.  There was some bleeding from the inferotemporal frond.  This was managed by raising the intraocular pressure and using intraocular cautery.  The surgical view became cloudy and the corneal epithelium was removed with a beaver blade.  This improved the view.  There is an area suspicious for retinal break near where the severe traction was inferotemporally.  The Endo laser was used to treat in a panretinal scatter fashion to areas that had not received previous treatment.  The indirect ophthalmoscope was used to examine the retinal peripheral for 360 degrees and no tears, holes or dialyses were seen.  There was some residual hemorrhagic vitreous skirt seen.  The soft-tip cannula was then used to perform an air-fluid exchange.  Additional laser was placed around the suspicious area inferotemporally.  The sclerotomies were then closed with 8-0 nylon suture in an X-fashion, the infusion cannula was removed and it sclerotomy closed with the pre-existing 8-0 nylon suture.,The conjunctiva was closed with 6-0 plain gut.  A subconjunctival injection of Ancef and Decadron were given and a drop of atropine was instilled over the eye.  The lid speculum was removed.  Maxitrol ointment was instilled over the eye and the eye was patched.

As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.  After all the vitreous had been removed and the membranes released, the retina was completely mobilized.  Total fluid-air exchange was carried out with complete settling of the retina.  Endolaser was applied around the margins of the retinal tears, and altogether several 100 applications were placed in the periphery.  Good reaction was achieved.

A speculum was placed into the vagina.  A single tooth tenaculum was utilized to grasp the anterior lip of the uterine cervix.  The uterus was sounded to 10.5 cm.  A #10 RUMI cannula was utilized and attached for uterine manipulation.  The single-tooth tenaculum and speculum were removed from the vagina.  At this time, the infraumbilical area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and infraumbilical vertical skin incision was made through which a Veress needle was inserted into the abdominal cavity.  Aspiration was negative; therefore the abdomen was insufflated with carbon dioxide.  After adequate insufflation, Veress needle was removed and an 11-mm separator trocar was introduced through the infraumbilical incision into the abdominal cavity.  Through the trocar sheath, the laparoscope was inserted and adequate visualization of the pelvic structures was noted.  At this time, the suprapubic area was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine.  A 5-mm skin incision was made and a 5-mm trocar was introduced into the abdominal cavity for instrumentation.  Evaluation of the pelvis revealed the uterus to be slightly enlarged and irregular.  The fallopian tubes have been previously interrupted surgically.  The ovaries appeared normal bilaterally.  The cul-de-sac was clean without evidence of endometriosis, scarring or adhesions.  The ureters were noted to be deep in the pelvis.  At this time, the right cornu was grasped and the right fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected without difficulty.  The remainder of the uterine vessels and anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligament, as well as the cardinal ligament was coagulated and transected in a serial fashion down to level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  A similar procedure was carried out on the left with the left uterine cornu identified.  The left fallopian tube, uteroovarian ligament, and round ligaments were doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The remainder of the cardinal ligament, uterine vessels, anterior, and posterior sheaths of the broad ligament were coagulated and transected in a serial manner to the level of the uterine artery.  The uterine artery was identified.  It was doubly coagulated with bipolar electrocautery and transected.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was then dissected to the midline bilaterally, establishing a bladder flap with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  At this time, attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The laparoscope was removed and attention was made to the vaginal hysterectomy.  The RUMI cannula was removed and the anterior and posterior leafs of the cervix were grasped with Lahey tenaculum.  A circumferential injection with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was made at the cervicovaginal portio.  A circumferential incision was then made at the cervicovaginal portio.  The anterior and posterior colpotomies were accomplished with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection without difficulty.  The right uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The left uterosacral ligament was clamped, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The parametrial tissue was then clamped bilaterally, transected, and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture bilaterally.  The uterus was then removed and passed off the operative field.  Laparotomy pack was placed into the pelvis.  The pedicles were evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted; therefore, the laparotomy pack was removed.

Live male infant with Apgars of 9 and 9.,2.  Placenta delivered spontaneously intact with a three-vessel cord.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient and baby remain in the LDR in stable condition.,SUMMARY: , This is a 36-year-old G1 woman who was pregnant since 40 weeks 6 days when she was admitted for induction of labor for post dates with favorable cervix.  When she was admitted, her cervix was 2.5 cm dilated with 80% effacement.  The baby had a -2 station.  She had no regular contractions.  Fetal heart tones were 120s and reactive.  She was started on Pitocin for labor induction and labored quite rapidly.  She had spontaneous rupture of membranes with a clear fluid.  She had planned on an epidural; however, she had sudden rapid cervical change and was unable to get the epidural.  With the rapid cervical change and descent of fetal head, there were some variable decelerations.  The baby was at a +1 station when the patient began pushing.  I had her push to get the baby to a +2 station.  During pushing, the fetal heart tones were in the 80s and did not recover in between contractions.  Because of this, I recommended a vacuum delivery for the baby.  The patient agreed.,The baby's head was confirmed to be in the right occiput anterior presentation.  The perineum was injected with 1% lidocaine.  The bladder was drained.  The vacuum was placed and the correct placement in front of the posterior fontanelle was confirmed digitally.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was inflated and a gentle downward pressure was used to assist with brining the baby's head to a +3 station.  The contraction ended.  The vacuum was released and the fetal heart tones remained in the, at this time, 90s to 100s.  With the patient's next contraction, the vacuum was reapplied and the baby's head was delivered to a +4 station.  A modified Ritgen maneuver was used to stabilize the fetal head.  The vacuum was deflated and removed.  The baby's head then delivered atraumatically.  There was no nuchal cord.  The baby's anterior shoulder delivered after a less than 30 second delay.  No additional maneuvers were required to deliver the anterior shoulder.  The posterior shoulder and remainder of the body delivered easily.  The baby's mouth and nose were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped x2 and cut.  The infant was handed to the respiratory therapist.,Pitocin was added to the patient's IV fluids.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was intact and had a three-vessel cord.  A vaginal inspection revealed a third-degree midline laceration as well as a right vaginal side wall laceration.  The right side wall laceration was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion with local anesthesia.  The third-degree laceration was also repaired with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Local anesthesia was used.  The capsule was visible, but did not appear to be injured at all.  It was reinforced with three separate interrupted sutures and then the remainder of the incision was closed with #3-0 Vicryl in the typical fashion.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  She remains in the LDR with the baby.  The baby is vigorous, crying and moving all extremities.  He will go to the new born nursery when ready.  The total time for repair of the laceration was 25 minutes.","surgery, intrauterine pregnancy, non-reassuring fetal heart tones, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, vaginal side wall laceration, fetal heart tones, vaginal delivery, vacuum assisted, laceration, intrauterine, tones, contractions, "

208, Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction., Surgery, Upper Endoscopy  ,"PROCEDURE:,  Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.,The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.,IMPRESSION: , Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.","surgery, dysphagia, removal of food impaction, distal esophagus, stomach, distal esophageal, esophageal stricture, upper endoscopy, food impaction, endoscopy, aspiration, sedation, bolus, impaction, esophagus, "

The patient was estimated to be approximately 10-1/2 weeks so long in her pregnancy.  She began to have heavy vaginal bleeding and intense lower pelvic cramping.  She was seen in the emergency room where she was found to be hemodynamically stable.  On pelvic exam, her cervix was noted to be 1 to 2 cm dilated and approximately 90% effaced.  There were bulging membranes protruding through the dilated cervix.  These symptoms were consistent with the patient's prior experience of spontaneous miscarriages.  These findings were reviewed with her and options for treatment discussed.  She elected to proceed with an exam under anesthesia with uterine suction curettage.  The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her and knowing these, she gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed in the seated position.  A spinal anesthetic was successfully administered.  She was then moved to a dorsal lithotomy position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate spinal level was confirmed, a bimanual exam was again performed.  This revealed the uterus to be anteverted to axial and approximately 10 to 11 weeks in size.  The previously noted cervical exam was confirmed.  The weighted vaginal speculum was then inserted and the vaginal vault flooded with povidone solution.  This solution was then removed approximately 10 minutes later with dry sterile gauze sponge.  The anterior cervical lip was then attached with a ring clamp.  The tissue and membranes protruding through the os were then gently grasped with a ring clamp and traction applied.  The tissue dislodged revealing fluid mixed with blood as well as an apparent 10-week fetus.  The placental tissue was then gently tractioned out as well.  A size 9 curved suction curette was then gently inserted through the dilated os and into the endometrial cavity.  With the vacuum tubing applied in rotary motion, a moderate amount of tissue consistent with products of conception was evacuated.  The sharp curette was then utilized to probe the endometrial surface.  A small amount of additional tissue was then felt in the posterior uterine wall.  This was curetted free.  A second pass was then made with a vacuum curette.  Again, the endometrial cavity was probed with a sharp curette and no significant additional tissue was encountered.  A final pass was then made with a suction curette.,The ring clamp was then removed from the anterior cervical lip.  There was only a small amount of bleeding following the curettage.  The weighted speculum was then removed as well.  The bimanual exam was repeated and good involution was noted.  The patient was taken down from the dorsal lithotomy position.  She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The sponge and instrument count was performed and found to be correct.  The specimen of products of conception and 10-week fetus were submitted to Pathology for further evaluation.  The estimated blood loss for the procedure is less than 10 mL.","surgery, spontaneous, incomplete abortion, uterine suction curettage, fetus, anterior cervical lip, spontaneous incomplete abortion, bimanual exam, ring clamp, suction curettage, uterine, curettage, suction"

The patient was brought to the operative suite where he was placed in supine position and general endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away and a shoulder roll was placed and a McIvor mouthgag was inserted into the oral cavity.  Correct inspection and palpation did not reveal evidence of a bifid uvula or submucosal clots.  Attention was directed first to the right tonsil in which a curved Allis forceps was applied to the superior pole.  The needle-tip Bovie cautery was used to incise the mucosa of the anterior tonsillar pillar.  Once the tonsillar pillar was identified and the superior pole was released, the curved forceps with a straight Allis forceps and the dissection was carried down inferiorly, dissecting the tonsil free from all fascial attachments.  Once the tonsil was delivered from the oral cavity, hemostasis was obtained within the tonsillar fossa utilizing suction cautery.,Attention was then directed over to the left tonsil in which a similar procedure was performed.  Once all bleeding was controlled, the mucosa of both the hard and soft palate was anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:50000 epinephrine solution.  Now attention was directed to the posterior pillars.  A hemostat was used to clamp the posterior pillar, which was then taken down with Metzenbaum scissors.  The posterior pillar was then approximated to the anterior pillar with the use of #3-0 PDS suture so as to create a box shaped soft palate.  Now, the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and #12 blade scalpel was used to incise the mucosa of the soft palate extending down onto the uvula.  The mucosa was dissected off with the use of Potts scissors.  Now the uvula was reflected onto the soft palate and sutured down in place with use of #3-0 PDS suture approximated with deep muscle layers.  Now the mucosa of the soft palate and the uvula were approximated with interrupted #3-0 PDS sutures.  Finally, #4-0 Vicryl sutures were placed intermittently between the PDS to further secure the uvula, which had been reflected onto the soft palate.  A final #3-0 PDS suture was used to further approximate the anterior and posterior tonsil pillars.  Final inspection did not reveal any further bleeding.  The mouth was then irrigated with saline and suctioned.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  He was awakened and taken to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted as an observation patient to the Telemetry Floor for routine postoperative management.  Of note, IV Decadron was administered during the procedure.","surgery, endotracheal, metzenbaum, soft palate, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, obstructive, mucosa, uvula, palate,"

He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past.  He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Formation of urethral strictures.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room.  General LMA anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped.  Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator.  The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe.  The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions.  The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula.  There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone.  Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe.  Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down.  Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator.  A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis.  The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained.  The patient tolerated the operation well.","surgery, benign prostatic hyperplasia, cystoscopy, foley catheter, turp, transurethral, bladder, bladder diverticula, electrosurgical, obturator, prostate, resectoscopic, transurethral resection, urinary retention, resection of the prostate, transurethral electrosurgical resection, anesthesia, hyperplasia, resection, prostatic"
221, Tube Shunt  - Ahmed valve model S2 implant with pericardial reinforcement - Sample/Template., Surgery, Tube Shunt - Ahmed Valve Implant ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Open angle glaucoma OX,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Open angle glaucoma OX,PROCEDURE:, Ahmed valve model S2 implant with pericardial reinforcement XXX eye,INDICATIONS: ,This is a XX-year-old (wo)man with glaucoma in the OX eye, uncontrolled by maximum tolerated medical therapy.,PROCEDURE: ,The risks and benefits of glaucoma surgery were discussed at length with the patient including bleeding, infection, reoperation, retinal detachment, diplopia, ptosis, loss of vision, and loss of the eye, corneal hemorrhage, hypotony, elevated pressure, worsening of glaucoma, and corneal edema. Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox and Ocular. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A speculum was placed on the eyelids and microscope was brought into position. A #7-0 Vicryl suture was passed through the superotemporal limbus and traction suture was placed at the superotemporal limbus and the eye was rotated infranasally so as to expose the superotemporal conjunctiva. At this point, smooth forceps and Westcott scissors were used to create a 100-degree superotemporal conjunctival peritomy, approximately 2 mm posterior to the superotemporal limbus. This was then dissected anteriorly to the limbus edge and then posteriorly. Steven scissors were then dissected in a superotemporal quadrant between the superior and lateral rectus muscles to provide good exposure. At this point, we primed the Ahmed valve with a #27 gauge cannula using BSS and it was noted to be patent. We then placed Ahmed valve in the superotemporal subconjunctival recess underneath the subtenon space and this was pushed posteriorly. We then measured with calipers so that it was positioned 9 mm posterior to the limbus. The Ahmed valve was then tacked down with #8-0 nylon suture through both fenestrations. We then applied light cautery to the superotemporal episcleral bed. We placed a paracentesis at the temporal position and inflated the anterior chamber with a small amount of Healon. We then used a #23 gauge needle and entered the superotemporal sclera, approximately 1 mm posterior to the limbus into the anterior chamber away from iris and away from cornea. We then trimmed the tube, beveled up in a 30 degree fashion with Vannas scissors, and introduced the tube through the #23 gauge tract into the anterior chamber so that approximately 2-3 mm of tube was extending into the anterior chamber. We burped some of the Healon out of the anterior chamber and filled it with BSS and we felt that the tube was in good position away from the lens, away from the cornea, and away from the iris. We then tacked down the tubes to the sclera with #8-0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of- eight fashion. The pericardium was soaked in gentamicin. We then folded the pericardium 1x1 cm piece onto itself and then placed it over the tube and this was tacked down in all four quadrants to the sclera with #8-0 nylon suture. At this point, we then re-approximated the conjunctiva to its original position and we closed it with an #8-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle in a running fashion with interrupted locking bites. We then removed the traction suture. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was deep, the tube appeared to be well positioned. The remaining portion of the Healon was burped out of the anterior chamber with BSS and the pressure was felt to be adequate. The speculum was removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Then, an eye patch and shield were placed over the eye. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, tube shunt, ahmed valve, healon, maxitrol ointment, ocuflox, open angle, anterior chamber, bleeding, conjunctival peritomy, cornea, corneal edema, corneal hemorrhage, diplopia, elevated pressure, glaucoma, hypotony, infection, loss of the eye, loss of vision, ophthalmic fashion, ptosis, reoperation, retinal detachment, sclera, superotemporal, worsening of glaucoma, ahmed valve model, superotemporal limbus, eye, ahmed, implant, bss, valve, limbus, "

After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion.  After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated.  The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally.  A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally.,After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon.  The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected.  A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case.  The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed.  The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally.  The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided.  The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns.  The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight.  The wound was irrigated.  The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples.  Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa.  A posterior splint was applied.  Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape.

Left canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction.,2.  Microdissection.,3.  NIM facial nerve monitoring for three hours.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,FINDINGS:,  There is an extremely large canal cholesteatoma, which eroded most of the posterior and superior canal wall.  There was a significant amount of myringosclerosis and tympanosclerosis.  There is some mild erosion of the lenticular process of the incus.  The facial nerve was normal.  We removed the incus, removed the head of the malleus, and placed a titanium-PORP from the stapes capitulum to a cartilage graft.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthetic and intubated without difficulty.  The NIM facial nerve monitoring electrodes were positioned and monitoring was performed throughout the procedure.  There was no abnormal activity during this case.  We inspected the ear canal, identified the huge defect, which was completely filled with cerumen.  Through the ear canal, we removed as much as we could and then infiltrated the canal and postauricular area with 1:100,000 of epinephrine.,We prepped and draped the ear in a sterile fashion.  We reopened the previously used postauricular incision and dissected down the mastoid cortex.  We reflected the soft tissues anteriorly to the level of the ear canal and identified where the ear canal skin entered the defect in the mastoid bone.  A #6 cutting bur was used to drill down the mastoid cortex and identified this cholesteatoma which was then carefully dissected out.  We went all the way to the mastoid antrum.  We finished a complete mastoidectomy with identification of the tegmen, sigmoid sinus.  We removed the lateral aspect of the mastoid tip.  We lowered the facial ridge.  The incudostapedial joint was already membranous in nature, we went ahead and used the joint knife and removed the incus.  We separated the incus from the stapes and then removed it.  We used a malleus head nipper to remove the head of the malleus and then we continued to saucerize the entire mastoid cavity.,There was no cholesteatoma within the middle ear space, but there was roughly 40% surface area perforation.  The remaining portion of the tympanic membrane was extremely calcified and myringosclerotic; this was removed.  There was also a large focus of tympanosclerosis between the stapes crura, which was impinging the ability of the stapes to move.  We carefully dissected this out.  This did seem to improve the mobility of the stapes somewhat.  At this point, there was a near total perforation.  There was only a minimal amount of anterior remnant of the drum left.  We tried to go ahead and harvest the temporalis fascia, but there was really only wisps of this fascia in place.  He had already had a previous tympanoplasty, but even outside the areas where the graft was taken, the temporalis muscle was quite atrophied and lumpy, and I suspect this was due to his chronic disease and long history of corticosteroid usage.  We harvested a few pieces as best as we could.  We went ahead and did a meatoplasty by making a canal incision in the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.  We excised cartilage posteriorly and inferiorly to enlarge the meatus.  This cartilage was thin and used for cartilage tympanoplasty.  We placed some Gelfoam in the middle ear space and placed the cartilage on the top of it.  We did cut a titanium-PORP of the proper side and placed on top of the stapes capitulum to interface with the cartilage cap.  A few other small pieces of temporalis fascia were used to bulge through the surrounding edges of the cartilage and make sure that it was medial to any remnant of ear canal and tympanic membrane remnants.  We placed a layer of Gelfoam lateral to the graft, closed the postauricular incision in layers and put 2 Merocel packs in the ear.  Glasscock dressing was applied.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  He will be given antibiotics and pain medicines and he will be given instructions to follow up with me in one week.","surgery, cholesteatoma, gelfoam, glasscock dressing, microdissection, nim, canal, canal wall, cerumen, facial nerve, incus, myringosclerosis, ossicular chain reconstruction, titanium-porp, tympanomastoidectomy, tympanosclerosis, facial nerve monitoring, ear canal, cartilage, ear,"

The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.,An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed® Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.,Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.

Upon visualization of the pelvis organs, the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries were all normal.  The probe was withdrawn and replaced with the bipolar cautery instrument.  The right fallopian tube was grasped approximately 1 cm distal to the cornual region of the uterus.  Electrical current was applied to the tube at this point and fulgurated.  The tube was then regrasped just distal to this and refulgurated.  It was then regrasped just distal to the lateral point and refulgurated again.  The same procedure was then carried out on the opposite tube.  The bipolar cautery instrument was withdrawn and replaced with the probe.  The fallopian tubes were again traced to their fimbriated ends to confirm the burn points on the tubes.  The upper abdomen was visualized, and the liver surface was normal.  The gas was allowed to escape from the abdomen, and the instruments were removed.  The skin incisions were repaired.  The instruments were removed from the vagina.,There were no complications to the procedure.  Blood loss was minimal.  The patient went to the postanesthesia recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, tubal fulguration, cohen cannula, laparoscopic, trendelenburg position, veress needle, abdominal cavity, bipolar cautery, dorsal lithotomy, fallopian tubes, fimbriated ends, fulgurated, laparoscope, uterus, distal, trocar, tubesNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4.,2.  Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , None.,HISTORY: , This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain.  An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root.  Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally.  There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal.  I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root.  But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient.  So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Endotracheal intubation followed.  The patient received the Foley catheter.  She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3.  Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature.  At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified.  A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically.  Next, a microscope was brought onto the field.  The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization.  A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis.  At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen.  As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI.  A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc.  Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance.  The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged.  The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue.  There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root.  There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root.  As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure.  So, at this point there is no further decompression.  A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral.  The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially.  The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision.  The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","surgery, dorsal root ganglia, nerve root, discectomy, foraminal disc herniation, transpedicular decompression, lateral aspects, disc herniation, nerve, anesthesia, foraminal"

She required intubation and has been ventilator-dependent in the Intensive Care since that time.  The patient developed very high temperatures as well as leukocytosis.  Her lines required being changed.,PROCEDURE:,1.  RIGHT BRACHIAL ARTERIAL LINE:  ,The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  There was a good brachial pulse palpated.  The artery was cannulated with the provided needle and the kit.  There was good arterial blood return noted immediately.  On the first stick, the Seldinger wire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the right brachial artery without difficulty.  The needle was removed and a catheter was inserted over the Seldinger wire to cannulate the brachial artery.  The femoral catheter was used in this case secondary to the patient's severe edema and anasarca.  We did not feel that the shorter catheter would provide enough length.  The catheter was connected to the system and flushed without difficulty.  A good waveform was noted.  The catheter was sutured into place with #3-0 silk suture and OpSite dressing was placed over this.,2.  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN TRIPLE LUMEN CATHETER:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% Xylocaine was used to anesthetize an area just inferior and lateral to the angle of the clavicle.  Using the anesthetic needle, we checked down to the soft tissues anesthetizing, as we proceeded to the angle of the clavicle, this was also anesthetized.  Next, a #18 gauge thin walled needle was used following the same track to the angle of clavicle.  We roughed the needle down off the clavicle and directed it towards the sternal notch.  There was good venous return noted immediately.  The syringe was removed and a Seldinger guidewire was inserted through the needle to cannulate the vein.  The needle was then removed.  A small skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel and the provided dilator was used to dilate the skin, soft tissue and vein.  Next, the triple lumen catheter was inserted over the guidewire without difficulty.  The guidewire was removed.  All the ports aspirated and flushed without difficulty.

General inhalational anesthesia was administered through the patient's existing 4.0 endotracheal tube.  The neck was extended and secured with tape and incision in the midline of the neck approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the sternal notch was outlined.  The incision measured approximately 1 cm and was just below the palpable cricoid cartilage and first tracheal ring.  The incision area was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.  A #67 blade was used to perform the incision.  Electrocautery was used to remove excess fat tissue to expose the strap muscles.  The strap muscles were grasped and divided in the midline with a cutting electrocautery.  Sharp dissection was used to expose the anterior trachea and cricoid cartilage.  The thyroid isthmus was identified crossing just below the cricoid cartilage.  This was divided in the midline with electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was used to expose adequate cartilaginous rings.  A 4.0 silk was used for stay sutures to the midline of the cricoid.  Additional stay sutures were placed on each side of the third tracheal ring.  Thin DuoDerm was placed around the stoma.

Informed consent was obtained. Patient received several sets of drops in his/her XXX eye including Ocuflox, Ocular, and pilocarpine. (S)He was taken to the operating room where monitored anesthetic care was initiated. Retrobulbar anesthesia was then administered to the XXX eye using a 50:50 mixture of 2% plain lidocaine and 0.05% Marcaine. The XXX eye was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion and the microscope was brought in position. A Lieberman lid speculum was used to provide exposure. Vannas scissors and smooth forceps were used to create a 6 mm limbal peritomy superiorly. This was dissected posteriorly with Vannas scissors to produce a fornix based conjunctival flap. Residual episcleral vessels were cauterized with Eraser-tip cautery. Sponges soaked in mitomycin C 0.3 mm per cc were then placed underneath the conjunctival flap and allowed to sit there for 3 minutes checked against the clock. Sponges were removed and area was copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution. A Super blade was then used to fashion a partial thickness limbal based trapezoidal scleral flap. This was dissected anteriorly with a crescent blade to clear cornea. A temporal paracentesis was then made. Scleral flap was lifted and a Super blade was used to enter the anterior chamber. A Kelly-Descemet punch was used to remove a block of limbal tissue. DeWecker scissors were used to perform a surgical iridectomy. The iris was then carefully reposited back into place and the iridectomy was visible through the clear cornea. A scleral flap was then re- approximated back on the bed. One end of the scleral flap was closed with a #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The other end of the scleral flap was closed with #10-0 nylon suture in interrupted fashion and the knot was buried. The anterior chamber was then refilled with balanced salt solution and a small amount of fluid was noted to trickle out of the scleral flap with slow shallowing of the chamber. Therefore it was felt that another #10-0 nylon suture should be placed and it was therefore placed in interrupted fashion half way between each of the end sutures previously placed. The anterior chamber was then again refilled with balanced salt solution and it was noted that there was a small amount of fluid tricking out of the scleral flap and the pressure was felt to be adequate in the anterior chamber. Conjunctiva was then re-approximated to the limbus and closed with #9-0 Vicryl suture on a TG needle at each of the peritomy ends. Then a horizontal mattress style #9-0 Vicryl suture was placed at the center of the conjunctival peritomy. The conjunctival peritomy was checked for any leaks and was noted to be watertight using Weck- cel sponge. The anterior chamber was inflated and there was noted that the superior bleb was well formed. At the end of the case, the pupil was round, the chamber was formed and the pressure was felt to be adequate. Speculum and drapes were carefully removed. Ocuflox and Maxitrol ointment were placed over the eye. Atropine was also placed over the eye. Then an eye patch and eye shield were placed over the eye. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.

Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending.","surgery, ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, multiple strokes, thyroid, thyroid isthmusectomy, ventilator dependent, respiratory failure, strap muscles, thyroid gland, endotracheal tube, cricoid cartilage, bovie cautery, tracheostomy, ventilator, strokes, cartilage, tracheal, isthmusectomy"

The patient had subsequently been taken to the operating room by Department of Otolaryngology and a direct laryngoscope was performed.  The patient was noted at that time to have transglottic edema.  Biopsies were taken.  At the time of surgery, it was decided that the patient required a tracheostomy for maintenance of continued ventilation and airway protection.  The patient is currently postop day #6 and appears to be unable to be weaned from ventilator at this time and may require prolonged ventricular support.  A decision was made to perform tracheostomy change.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was seen in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was placed in a supine position.  The neck was then extended.  The sutures that were previously in place in the #6 Shiley with proximal extension were removed.  The patient was preoxygenated to 100%.  After several minutes, the patient was noted to have a pulse oximetry of 100%.  The IV tubing that was supporting the patient's trache was then cut.  The tracheostomy tube was then suctioned.,The inner cannula was then removed from the tracheostomy and a nasogastric tube was placed down the lumen of the tracheostomy tube as a guidewire.  The tracheostomy tube was then removed over the nasogastric tube and the operative field was suctioned.  With the guidewire in place and with adequate visualization, a new #6 Shiley with proximal extension was then passed over the nasogastric tube guidewire and carefully inserted into the trachea.  The guidewire was then removed and the inner cannula was then placed into the tracheostomy.  The patient was then reconnected to the ventilator and was noted to have normal tidal volumes.  The patient had a tidal volume of 500 and was returning 500 cc to 510 cc.  The patient continued to saturate well with saturations 99%.  The patient appeared comfortable and her vital signs were stable.  A soft trache collar was then connected to the trachesotomy.  A drain sponge was then inserted underneath the new trache site.  The patient was observed for several minutes and was found to be in no distress and continued to maintain adequate saturations and continued to return normal tidal volumes.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well.  0.25% acetic acid soaks were ordered to the drain sponge every shift.","surgery, shiley, proximal extension, ventilator-dependent, respiratory failure, laryngeal edema, tracheostomy, cannula, respiratory, laryngeal, nasogastric, edema, ventilator"

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","surgery, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula, cartilage, cricoid, flexible, foreign body, mainstem, obstruction, perichondrium, stenosis, stent, subglottic, swallowing, trachea, tracheal, tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy, shiley single cannula tracheostomy, shiley single cannula, single cannula tracheostomy, thyroid isthmus, stent material, tracheostomy tube, tube, thyroid, "

The patient subsequently then had a CT scan which demonstrated a very large thyroid gland, especially on the left side with substernal extension down to the level of the aortic arch.  The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

The patient was placed on the operative table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient was then placed upon a shoulder roll.  After this, the skin incision was marked approximately two fingerbreadths above the sternal notch.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:1000 approximately 7 cc total.,After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a #10 blade was then utilized to make a skin incision.  The subcutaneous tissue was then bluntly dissected utilizing a Ray-Tec sponge and a bear claw was then utilized to retract the upper incisional skin with counter retraction performed to allow a subplatysmal plane of skin flaps to be performed in superior and inferolateral directions.  After this, the midline was then identified and grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps.  The raphe was noted and Bovie cauterization was utilized to cut down into this region.  The fine stats were utilized to further open this area with exposure and bisection of the sternothyroid muscle.  It was separated on the left side from the patient's sternothyroid muscle.  After this, the sternothyroid muscle was identified, grasped with the DeBakey forceps and infiltrated initially through its fascial plane with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Blunt dissection was then utilized to free the sternothyroid muscle from the thyroid gland in superior and inferior directions and laterally with the help of Kitners.  After this, the plane was rotated more anteriorly with the superior and inferior parathyroid glands identified.  The fat cap was noted to be attached on the superior parathyroid to the posterior aspect of the thyroid itself.  It was freed from the thyroid gland and reflected laterally and posteriorly.  The inferior parathyroid gland actually appeared to be attached also to the inferior aspect of the thyroid itself and was reflected laterally.  After this, the patient's thyroid gland was palpated noting a thyroid nodule in the posterior inferior aspect along with the calcification laterally.  The nodule appeared to be sort of rubbery in consistency and approximately 1 cm diameter.  As the gland was rotated more anteriorly, the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side was identified and further dissection along Berry's ligament on the medial aspect was performed.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid artery were both cauterized with a bipolar cautery and bisected.  After this, the gland was easily rotated anteriorly with further dissection carried up to the superior pole.  The superior pole was exposed with the help of a Richardson and Army-Navy retractors with cross-clamping and tying of the superior laryngeal artery and vein.  Further, the small bleeding vessels were identified and bipolared, and cut with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The superior pole was finally freed and the gland was rotated more anteriorly onto the anterior aspect of the trachea.  Berry's ligament was finally freed and the gland was cross-clamped on the opposing thyroid isthmus with a mosquito.  After this, the gland was cut with a Metzenbaum scissors and tied with a #3-0 undyed Vicryl tie.  The defect on the neck now was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  Surgicel was then cut in small strips and three replaced in the lateral part of the neck.,The opposing side of the thyroid gland on the right was palpated with no noticeable nodules or masses.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl on a SH, followed by reapproximation of the subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by reapproximation of the skin by running subcuticular #5-0 Prolene and a #6-0 fast absorbing gut.

A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.", Surgery, Total Knee Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURES: , Total knee replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, a tourniquet was placed on the upper thigh.  Sterile prepping and draping proceeded.  The tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.  A midline incision was made, centered over the patella.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  A median parapatellar arthrotomy was performed.  The lateral patellar retinacular ligaments were released and the patella was retracted laterally.  Proximal medial tibia was denuded, with mild release of medial soft tissues.  The ACL and PCL were released.  The medial and lateral menisci and suprapatellar fat pad were removed.  These releases allowed for anterior subluxation of tibia.  An extramedullary tibial cutting jig was pinned to the proximal tibia in the appropriate alignment and flush cut was made along tibial plateau, perpendicular to the axis of the tibia.  Its alignment was checked with the rod and found to be adequate.  The tibia was then allowed to relocate under the femur.,An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur and a femoral rod attached to the anterior cutting block was inserted, and the block was pinned in appropriate position, judging correct rotation using a variety of techniques.  An anterior rough cut was made.  The distal cutting jig was placed atop this cut surface and pinned to the distal femur, and the rod was removed.  The distal cut was performed.,A spacer block was placed, and adequate balance in extension was adjusted and confirmed, as was knee alignment.  Femoral sizing was performed with the sizer, and the appropriate size femoral 4-in-1 chamfer-cutting block was pinned in place and the cuts were made.  The notch-cutting block was pinned to the cut surface, slightly laterally, and the notch cut was then made.  The trial femoral component was impacted onto the distal femur and found to have an excellent fit.  A trial tibial plate and polyethylene were inserted, and stability was judged and found to be adequate in all planes.  Appropriate rotation of the tibial component was identified and marked.  The trials were removed and the tibia was brought forward again.  The tibial plate size was checked and the plate was pinned to plateau.  A keel guide was placed and the keel was then made.  The femoral intramedullary hole was plugged with bone from the tibia.  The trial tibial component and poly placed; and, after placement of the femoral component, range of motion and stability were checked and found to be adequate in various ranges of flexion and extension.,The patella was held in a slightly everted position with knee in extension.  Patellar width was checked with calipers.  A free-hand cut of the patellar articular surface was performed and checked to ensure symmetry with the calipers.  Sizing was then performed and 3 lug holes were drilled with the jig in place, taking care to medialize and superiorize the component as much as possible, given bony anatomy.  Any excess lateral patellar bone was recessed.  The trial patellar component was placed and found to have adequate tracking.  The trials were removed; and as the cement was mixed, all cut surfaces were thoroughly washed and dried.  The cement was applied to the components and the cut surfaces with digital pressurization, and then the components were impacted.  The excess cement was removed from the gutters and anterior and posterior parts of the knee.  The knee was brought into full extension with the trial polyethylene and further axially pressurized as cement hardened.  Once the cement had hardened, the tourniquet was deflated.  The knee was dislocated again, and any excess cement was removed with an osteotome.  Thorough irrigation and hemostasis were performed.  The real polyethylene component was placed and pinned.  Further vigorous power irrigation was performed, and adequate hemostasis was obtained and confirmed.  The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Ethibond and Vicryl sutures.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was sealed with staples.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold-pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, proximal medial tibia, total knee replacement, parapatellar arthrotomy, subcutaneous tissues, tibial plateau, incision, cutting, patella, femur, femoral, component, knee,"

In the preoperative area, the patient received pilocarpine drops.  The patient received IV propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were given.  The operative eye then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lids, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A screw type speculum was inserted to maintain patency of lids.  A 6-0 Vicryl suture was placed through the superior cornea, and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior conjunctiva.  A peritomy was performed approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus and this flap was dissected forward to the cornea.  All Tenons were removed from the overlying sclera and the area was treated with wet-field cautery to achieve hemostasis.  A 2 mm x 3 mm scleral flap was then outlined with a Micro-Sharp blade.  This was approximately one-half scleral depth in thickness.  A crescent blade was then used to dissect forward the clear cornea.  Hemostasis was again achieved with wet-field cautery.  A Weck-Cel sponge tip soaked in mitomycin was then placed under the conjunctival and tenon flap and left there for two minutes.  The site was then profusely irrigated with balanced salt solution.  A paracentesis wound was made temporarily and then the Micro-Sharp blade was used to enter the anterior chamber at the anterior most margin of the trabeculectomy bed.  A Kelly-Descemet punch was then inserted, and a trabeculectomy was performed.  Iris was withdrawn through the trabeculectomy site and a peripheral iridectomy was performed using Vannas scissors and 0.12 forceps.  The iris was then repositioned into the eye and the anterior chamber was inflated with BSS.  The scleral flap was sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures with knots trimmed, rotated, and buried.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture on a BV needle.  BSS was irrigated in the anterior chamber and the blood was noted to elevate nicely without leakage.  Antibiotic and steroid drops were placed in the eye as was homatropine 5%.  The antibiotic consisted of Vigamox and the steroid was Econopred Plus.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after the drape was removed.

", Surgery, Total Knee Replacement ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: ,Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Degenerative arthritis of the left knee.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Total left knee replacement on 08/19/03.  The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 76 minutes.,BLOOD LOSS: , 150 cc.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE:,  NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component.  The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient.","surgery, degenerative arthritis, nexgen, polyethylene, cruciate, total knee replacement, proximal tibia, knee replacement, femoral, cutting, tibial, knee, arthritis, femur, cementation, "

She wishes to proceed with arthroplasty at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/11/03.  She was placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered a spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An Esmarch was applied and a tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg on the left thigh.  A longitudinal incision was made over the anterior portion of the knee and this was taken down through the subcutaneous tissue to the level of the patella retinaculum.  A medial peripatellar arthrotomy was then made and taken down to the level of the tibial tubercle.  Care was then ensured that the patellar tendon was not violated.  The proximal tibia was then skeletonized both medially and laterally to the level of the axis through the joint line.  Again care was ensured that the patellar tendon was not avulsed from the insertion on the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was then opened using a drill and the anterior sizing guide was then placed.  Rongeur was used to take out any osteophytes and the size of approximately size E. At this point, the epicondyle axis guide was then inserted and aligned in a proper orientation.  The anterior cutting guide was then placed.  Care was checked for the amount of resection that the femur would be notched and the oscillating saw was used to cut the anterior portion of the femur.  After this was performed, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed.  The left knee placed in 5 degrees of valgus, guide was then placed, and a standard distal cut was then taken.  After the cuts were ensured further to be leveled and they were, and we proceeded to place the finishing guide size E and distal femur.  This was placed slightly in lateral position and secured in position with spring tense and head lift tense.  Once adequately secured and placed in the appropriate orientation, the alignment was again verified with the epicondyle axis and appeared to be externally rotated appropriately.  The chamfer cuts and anterior and posterior cuts were then made as well as the notch cut using the reciprocating and oscillating saws.  After this was performed, the guide was removed and all bony fragments were then removed.  Attention was then directed to the tibia.  The external tibial alignment guide was then placed and pinned to the proximal tibia in a proper position.  Care was ensured if it is was a varus or valgus and the appropriate.  The femur gauge was then used to provide us appropriate amount of bony resection.  This was then pinned and secured into place.  Ligament retractors were used to protect the collateral ligaments and the tip proximal tibial cut was then made.  This bony portion was then removed and remaining meniscal fragments were removed as well as the ACL till adequate exposure was obtained.  Trial components were then inserted into position and taken the range of motion and found to have good and full excellent range of motion stability.  The trial components were then removed.  The tibia was then stemmed in standard fashion after the tibial plate was placed in some degree of external rotation with appropriate alignment.  After it was stemmed and broached, these were removed and the patella was then incised, a size 41 patella reamer blade was then used and was taken down, a size 38 patella button was then placed intact.  Again the trial components were placed back into position.  Patella button was placed and the tracking was evaluated.  They tracked centrally with no touch technique.  Again, all components were now removed and the knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Once adequately suctioned dry, the tibial portion was cemented and packed into place.  Also excess cement was removed.  The femoral component was then cemented into position.  All excess cement was removed.  A size 12 poly was then inserted in trial to provide compression at cement adhered.  The patella was then cemented and held into place.  All components were held under compression until cement had adequately adhered all excess cement was then removed.  The knee was then taken through range of motion and size 12 felt to be slightly too big, this was removed and the size 10 trial was replaced, and again had excellent varus and valgus stability with full range of motion and felt to be the articulate surface of choice.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  One last check in the posterior aspect of the knee for any loose bony fragments or osteophytes was performed, there were none found and a final articulating surface was impacted and locked into place.  After this, the knee was taken again for final range of motion and found to have excellent position, stability, and good alignment of the components.  The knee was once again copiously irrigated, and the tourniquet was deflated.  Bovie cautery was used to cauterize the knee bleeding that was seen until good hemostasis obtained.  A drain was then placed deep to the retinaculum and the retinaculum repair was performed using #2-0 Ethibond and oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  This was flexed and the repair was found held securely.  At this point, the knee was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was approximated with skin staples.  Sterile dressing with Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Kerlix rolls was then applied.

This subsequently became infected.  She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer.  She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  A Foley catheter was inserted.  A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site.  Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures.  The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up.  The previous surgical incision was identified.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent.  Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue.  Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue.  Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring.  There was no native tissue to orient oneself with.  We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer.  We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter.  Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed.  This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection.  The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur.  Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum.  A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure.  Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur.  This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum.  The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue.  This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie.  Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed.  Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell.  The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit.  Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur.  The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes.  Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal.  The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place.  Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur.  This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods.  The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem.  The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial.  The body was too tight proximally to fit.  The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body.  A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled.  This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill.  Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position.  Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur.  The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed.  Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly.  We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner.  Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly.  This was due to reversion of the femoral component.  As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion.  The stem was extracted and retrialed.  Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components.  A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell.  The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal.  Again, the hip was trialed.  The components were found to be in relative retroversion.  The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted.  Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion.  Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts.  The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated.  It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing.  Decision was made to accept the component position.  The real femoral head was selected and implanted.  The hip was then taken again to a range of motion.  It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation.  The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly.,The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage.  Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure.,The wound was then closed in a layered fashion.  A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin.  An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions.","surgery, infected, bipolar arthroplasty, antibiotic spacer, revision, placement of antibiotic spacer, total hip arthroplasty, scar tissue, soft tissue, antibiotic, spacer, femoral, hip, arthroplasty, total, acetabulum, femur, "

She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this.  They were performed by myself.  She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live.  Medial compartment had minor changes present.  There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides.  There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time.  A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation.  Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted.  The ligaments were balanced.  A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed.  Drill hole was made in the distal femur.  The size to an E, right.  Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side.  This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made.  Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out.  There was excellent resection.  It was flat.  Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  Appropriate cuts were carried out.  The standard cut was utilized.,The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws.  Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made.  The cutting guide was then removed.  The bone was removed.  Excess bone was taken out posteriorly.  The posterior capsule was loosened up.  There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened.  Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner.  An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held.  A cut was carried out parallel to the foot.  Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella.  The patella was isolated.  Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off.  The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled.  Trial range of motion was satisfactory.  The tibial guide was then pinned.  Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella.  The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella.  Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed.  There was excellent ligament balancing.

The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.","surgery, degenerative arthritis, total hip arthroplasty, tensor fascia lata, vastus lateralis, gluteus medius, femoral neck, femoral head, head, femoral, acetabulum, hip, attachment, arthroplasty,"
258," Total hip replacement.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. ", Surgery, Total Hip Replacement - 1 ,"PROCEDURE:,  Total hip replacement.,PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:,  The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table.  An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter.  Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues.  The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally.  The piriformis and external rotators were identified.  These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule.  The hip was dislocated.  A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating.  The femoral head was removed.  Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum.,Baseline leg-length measurements were taken.  The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed.  Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas.  The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit.  The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction.  Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  The trial liner was placed.,The femur was then flexed and internally rotated.  The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion.  An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal.  Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached.  The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version.  Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement.  Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation.  The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination.  Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability.,The real stem was opened and impacted into position.  The real head was impacted atop the stem.  If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version.  Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component.  Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction.,The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy.  The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures.  The skin was closed with nylon.  Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, range-of-motion, hip, total hip replacement, gluteus maximus, femoral head, subcutaneous tissues, incision, ethibond, trochanter, subcutaneous, acetabulum, femur"

After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed.  The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter.  This was angled posteriorly.  Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed.  This was incised with the use of scissors.  Gluteus maximus was separated.  The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb.  It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl.  Access to the capsule was performed.  The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects.  It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors.  The hip was then dislocated.  With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed.  The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes.  Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications.  The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position.  The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum.  A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap.  Our attention was then focused to the femur.  With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed.  The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component.  Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation.  In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation.  The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The wound was then closed in layers.  Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound.

The appendix was normal appearing.  The bowel and omentum were normal appearing.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  Peritoneal surfaces and vesicouterine peritoneum as well as appendix and cul-de-sac were all free of any evidence of endometriosis.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the Operating Room where first a spinal anesthesia with Astramorph was obtained without any difficulty.  She then underwent a general anesthesia with endotracheal tube also without any difficulty.  She was then examined under anesthesia with noted findings as above.  The patient was then placed in dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion..  A vertical skin incision was made 1 cm below the umbilicus extending down to 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was made with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia with the second knife.  Fascia was excised in the midline and extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum identified and entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with external visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was markedly evident upon entering the peritoneal cavity.  The uterus was then exteriorized and noted to have the findings as above.  At this point, approximately 10 cc of vasopressin 20 units and 30 cc was injected into the uterine fundus and multiple fibroids were removed by using the incision with the Bovie and then using a blunt and the sharp dissection and grasping with Lahey clamps.  Once the debulking of the uterus was felt appropriate to proceed with the hysterectomy, the uterus was then reapproximated with a few #0 Vicryl sutures in a figure-of-eight fashion.  The round ligaments were identified bilaterally and clamped with the hemostats and transacted with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The round ligaments were then bilaterally tied with the #0 tie and noted to be hemostatic.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were then isolated through a vascular window created from taking down the round ligaments.  The uterovarian vessels bilaterally were #0 tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transacted and suture tied with a Heaney hand stitch fashion, and both uterine and ovarian vessels were noted to be hemostatic.  At this time, the attention was then turned to the vesicouterine peritoneum, which was tented up with Allis clamps and the bladder flap was then created sharply with Russian pickups and the Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was bluntly dissected off the underlying cervix with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,At this point, the uterus was pulled on traction and the uterosacral ligaments were easily visualized.  Using #2-0 PDS suture, the suture was placed through both uterosacral ligaments distally with a backhand stitch fashion throwing the sutures from lateral to medial.  These sutures were then tagged and saved for later.  The uterine vessels were then identified bilaterally and skeletonized, then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps balancing off the cervix, and the uterine vessels were then transacted and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl and noted to be hemostatic.  In a similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the cardinal ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner and transacted and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  At this point, the Lahey clamp was placed on the cervix and the cervix was tented up.  The pubocervical vesical fascia was transacted with long knife.  Then while protecting posteriorly, using the double-pointed scissors, the vagina was entered with double-pointed scissors at the level of the cervix and was grasped with a straight Ochsner clamp.  The uterus and cervix were then amputated using the Jorgenson scissors and the cuff was outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then copiously painted with Betadine soaked sponge.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was placed in the patient's vagina.  Then the cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion to make sure to bring the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the vaginal cuff.  This was accomplished with one #0 Vicryl running stitch and then an Allis clamp was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff and tented up and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight was placed in the midsection portion of the cuff.  At this time, the uterosacral ligaments previously tagged needle was brought through the cardinal ligament and the uterosacral ligament on the ipsilateral side.  The needle was cut off and these were then tagged with the hemostats.  The cuff was then closed by taking the running suture and bringing back through the posterior peritoneum, grabbing part of the uterosacral and midsection portion of the posterior peritoneum of the uterosacral and then tying the cuff down to bunch and cuff together.  The suture in the midportion of the cuff was then used to tie down the round ligaments bilaterally to the cuff.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  Then the previously tagged uterosacral sutures were then tied bringing the vaginal cuff angles down to the uterosacral ligaments.  The abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  All areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The sigmoid colon was replaced back into the hollow of the sacrum.  Then the omentum was pulled over the bowel.  After the myomectomy was performed, the GYN Balfour was placed into the patient's abdomen and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  The GYN Balfour was then removed.  Packing sponges were removed and the fascia was then closed in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion with #0 Vicryl.,Skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The sponge from the patient's vagina was removed and the vagina was noted to be hemostatic.  The patient would be followed throughout her hospital stay.",

Next the neck, chest and legs were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the left of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw.  The chest retractor was positioned.  Next, full-dose heparin was given.  The pericardium was opened.  Pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  After obtaining adequate ACT, we prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 double pursestring of Ethibond suture was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed an aortic cannula connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our venous cannula connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  A 4-0 U-stitch was placed in the right atrium.  A retrograde cardioplegia catheter was positioned at this site.  Next, scissors were used to dissect out the right upper pulmonary vein.  A 4-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right upper pulmonary vein.  Next, a right-angle sump was placed at this position.  We then connected our retrograde cardioplegia catheter to the cardioplegia solution circuit.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the interface between the aorta and pulmonary artery.  The aorta was completely encircled.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  We then prepared to cross-clamp the aorta.  We went down on our flows and cross-clamped the aorta.  We backed up our flows.  We then gave antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia solution circuit so as to arrest the heart.  The patient had some aortic insufficiency so we elected, after initially arresting the heart, to open the aorta and transect it and then give direct ostial infusion of cardioplegia solution circuit.  Next, after obtaining complete diastolic arrest of the heart, we turned our attention to exposing the aortic valve, and 4-0 Tycron sutures were placed in the commissures.  In addition, a 2-0 Prolene suture was placed in the aortic wall so as to bring the aortic wall and root up into view.  Next, scissors were used to excise the diseased aortic valve leaflets.  Care was taken to remove all the calcium from the aortic annulus.  We then sized up the aortic annulus which came out to be a **-mm stentless porcine Toronto valve.  We prepared the valve.  Next, we placed our proximal suture line of interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures for the annulus.  We started with our individual commissural stitches.  They were connected to our valve sewing ring.  Next, we placed 5 interrupted 4-0 Tycron sutures in a subannular fashion at each commissural position.  After doing so, we passed 1 end of the suture through the sewing portion of the Toronto stentless porcine valve.  The valve was lowered into place and all of the sutures were tied.  Next, we gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  Next, we sewed our distal suture line.  We began with the left coronary cusp of the valve.  We ran a 5-0 RB needle up both sides of the valve.  Care was taken to avoid the left coronary ostia.  This procedure was repeated on the right cusp of the stentless porcine valve.  Again, care was taken to avoid any injury to the coronary ostia.  Lastly, we sewed our non-coronary cusp.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point we inspected our aortic valve.  There was good coaptation of the leaflets, and it was noted that both the left and the right coronary ostia were open.  We gave another round of cold blood antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  The antegrade portion was given in a direct ostial fashion once again.  We now turned our attention to closing the aorta.  A 4-0 Prolene double row of suture was used to close the aorta in a running fashion.  Just prior to closing, we de-aired the heart and gave a warm shot of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia.  At this point, we removed our aortic cross-clamp.  The heart gradually regained its electromechanical activity.  We placed 2 atrial and 2 ventricular pacing wires.  We removed our aortic vent and oversewed that site with another 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  We oversewed that site with a 5-0 Prolene.  By now, the heart was de-aired and resumed normal electromechanical activity.  We began to wean the patient from cardiopulmonary bypass.  We then removed our venous cannula and suture ligated that site with a #2 silk.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  After knowing that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed the aortic cannula.  We buttressed that site with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  We placed a mediastinal chest tube and brought it out through the skin.  We also placed 2 Blake drains, 1 in the left chest and 1 in the right chest, as the patient had some bilateral pleural effusions.  They were brought out through the skin.  The sternum was closed with #7 wires in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl.  We closed the subcu tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 PDS.","surgery, cardioplegia, toronto stentless porcine valve, tycron sutures, coronary ostia, porcine valve, retrograde cardioplegia, cardiopulmonary bypass, sutures, valve, insertion, toronto, aortic, stentless, chest, coronary, porcine, cardiopulmonary, prolene, atrial, bypass, heart, aorta,"

A scalpel was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision, which was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissue to the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the midline and incision was carried laterally bilaterally with curved Mayo scissors.  The fascia was then bluntly and sharply dissected free from the underlying rectus abdominis muscles.  The rectus abdominis muscles were then bluntly dissected in the midline and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The peritoneum was then bluntly entered and this incision was carried forward inferiorly and superiorly with care taken to avoid bladder and bowel.  The O'Connor-O'Sullivan instrument was then placed without difficulty.  The uterus was grasped with a thyroid clamp and the entire pelvis was then visualized without difficulty.  The GIA stapling instrument was then used to separate the infundibulopelvic ligament in a ligated fashion from the body of the uterus.  This was performed on the left infundibulopelvic ligament and the right infundibulopelvic ligament without difficulty.  Hemostasis was noted at this point of the procedure.  The bladder flap was then developed free from the uterus without difficulty.  Careful dissection of the uterus from the pedicle with the uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments was then performed using #1 chromic suture ligature in an interrupted fashion on the left and right side.

On ultrasound, the uterus measured 14 cm x 6.5 cm x 7.8 cm.  She had received two dosage of Lupron to help shrink the fibroid.  Her most recent Pap smear was normal.,FINDINGS: , On a manual exam, the uterus is enlarged approximately 14 to 16 weeks size with multiple fibroids palpated.  On laparotomy, the uterus did have multiple pedunculated fibroids, the largest being approximately 7 cm.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.,There was evidence of endometriosis on the posterior wall of the uterus as well as the bilateral infundibulopelvic ligament.  There was some adhesions of the bowel to the left ovary and infundibulopelvic ligament and as well as to the right infundibulopelvic ligament.,PROCEDURE:,  After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic was first administered and then general anesthetic.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made and carried to the underlying Mayo fashion using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in midline and the incision extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying rectus muscle both bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision, which in a similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, tented up and dissected off the underlying rectus muscles.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline and the peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostat, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus was then brought up out of the incision.  The bowel adhesions were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors.  Good hemostasis was noted at this point.  The self-retaining retractor was then placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was gently packed with moist laparotomy sponges and held in place with the blade on the GYN extension.  The uterus was then grasped with a Lahey clamp and brought up out of the incision.  The left round ligament was identified and grasped with Allis clamp and tented up.  A hemostat was passed in the avascular area beneath the round ligament.  A suture #0 Vicryl was used to suture ligate the round ligament.  Two hemostats were placed across the round ligament proximal to the previously placed suture and the Mayo scissors were used to transect the round ligament.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then identified and entered bluntly.  The suture of #0 Vicryl was then used to suture ligate the left uterovarian ligament.  Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the uterovarian ligament proximal to the previous suture.  The ligament was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the right round ligament, which in a similar fashion was tented up with an Allis clamp.  An avascular area was entered beneath the round ligament using a hemostat and the round ligament was suture ligated and transected.  An avascular area of the broad ligament was then entered bluntly and the right uterovarian ligament was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.,Two straight Ochsner's were placed across the ligament proximal to previous suture.  This was then transected and suture ligated again with #0 Vicryl.  The left uterine peritoneum was then identified and grasped with Allis clamps.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then transected and then entered using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended across the anterior portion of the uterus and the bladder flap was taken down.  It was sharply advanced with Metzenbaum scissors and then bluntly using a moist Ray-Tec.  The Ray-Tec was left in place at this point to ensure that the bladder was below the level of the cervix.  The bilateral uterine arteries then were skeletonized with Metzenbaum scissors and clamped bilaterally using straight Ochsner's.  Each were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  A curved Ochsner was then placed on either side of the cervix.  The tissue was transected using a long knife and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Incidentally, prior to taking down the round ligaments, a pedunculated fibroid and the right fundal portion of the uterus was injected with Vasopressin and removed using a Bovie.  The cervix was then grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The cervicovaginal fascia was then taken down first using the long-handed knife and then a back handle of the knife to bring the fascia down below the level of the cervix.  A double-pointed scissors were used to enter the vaginal vault below the level of the cervix.  A straight Ochsner was placed on the vaginal vault.  The Jorgenson scissors were used to amputate the cervix and the uterus off of the underlying vaginal tissue.  The vaginal cuff was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the pelvis was copiously irrigated.  There was a small area of bleeding noted on the underside of the bladder.  The bladder was tented up using an Allis clamp and a figure-of-eight suture of #3-0 Vicryl was placed with excellent hemostasis noted at this point.  The uterosacral ligaments were then incorporated into the vaginal cuff and the cuff was synched down.  A figure-of-eight suture of #0 Vicryl was placed in the midline of the vaginal cuff in attempt to incorporate the bilateral round ligament.  The round ligament was too short.  It would be a maximal amount of stretch to incorporate, therefore, only the left round ligament was incorporated into the vaginal cuff.  The bilateral adnexal areas were then re-peritonealized with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The bladder flap was reapproximated to the vaginal cuff using one interrupted suture.  The pelvis was again irrigated at this point with excellent hemostasis noted.  Approximately 200 cc of saline with methylene blue was placed into the Foley to inflate the bladder.  There was no spillage of blue fluid into the abdomen.  The fluid again was allowed to drain.  All sponges were then removed and the bowel was allowed to return to its anatomical position.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated also with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was then closed with staples.,A previously placed Betadine soaked Ray-Tec was removed from the patient's vagina and sponge stick was used to assess any bleeding in the vaginal vault.  There was no appreciable bleeding.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital.","surgery, pelvic pain, pelvic endometriosis, astramorph, total abdominal hysterectomy, enlarged fibroid, metzenbaum scissors, vaginal cuff, scissors, vaginal, uterus, ligament, hysterectomy, endometriosis, pedunculated, fibroids, infundibulopelvic, uterovarian, abdominal, laparotomy, peritoneum, "

The patient has had approximately four to five episodes of adenotonsillitis per year for the last three to four years.,PROCEDURE: , Informed consent was properly obtained from the patient's parents and the patient was taken to the operating room #3 and was placed in a supine position.  He was placed under general endotracheal tube anesthesia by the Department of Anesthesia.  The bed was then rolled away from Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed beneath the shoulder blades and a blue towel was then fashioned as a turban wrap.  The McIvor mouth gag was carefully positioned into the patient's mouth with attention to avoid the teeth.,The retractor was then opened and the oropharynx was visualized.  The adenoid pad was then visualized with a laryngeal mirror.  The adenoids appeared to be 1+ and non-obstructing.  There was no evidence of submucosal cleft palate palpable.  There was no evidence of bifid uvula.  A curved Allis clamp was then used to grasp the superior pole of the right tonsil.  The tonsil was then retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision on the mucosa of the right anterior tonsillar pillar to find the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using a Bovie.  Tonsillar sponge was re-applied to the tonsillar fossa.  Suction cautery was then used to adequately obtain hemostasis with the tonsillar fossa.  Attention was then directed to the left tonsil.  The curved Allis was used to grasp the superior pole of the left tonsil and it was retracted inferiorly and medially.  Bovie cautery was used to make an incision in the mucosa of the left anterior tonsillar pillar and define the appropriate plane of dissection.  The tonsil was then dissected out within this plane using the Bovie.  Next, complete hemostasis was achieved within the tonsillar fossae using suction cautery.  After adequate hemostasis was obtained, attention was directed towards the adenoid pad.  The adenoid pad was again visualized and appeared 1+ and was non-obstructing.  Decision was made to use suction cautery to cauterize the adenoids.  Using a laryngeal mirror under direct visualization, the adenoid pad was then cauterized with care to avoid the eustachian tube orifices as well as the soft palate and inferior turbinates.  After cauterization was complete, the nasopharynx was again visualized and tonsillar sponge was applied.  Adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The tonsillar fossae were again visualized and no evidence of bleeding was evident.  The throat pack was removed from the oropharynx and the oropharynx was suctioned.  There was no evidence of any further bleeding.  A flexible suction catheter was then used to suction out the nasopharynx to the oropharynx.  The suction catheter was also used to suction up the stomach.  Final look revealed no evidence of further bleeding and 10 mg of Decadron was given intraoperatively.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, chronic adenotonsillitis, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, adenoid, tonsils, tonsillar fossa, tonsillar fossae, suction cautery, adenotonsillitis, oropharynx, hemostasis, cautery, suction, tonsillar"

The McIvor mouth gag was inserted and gently suspended.  Afrin was instilled in both sides of the nose and allowed to take effect for a period of time.  The hypertrophic tonsils were then removed by the suction and snare.  Deeply cryptic changes as expected were evident.  Bleeding was minimal and controlled with packing followed by electrocautery followed by extensive additional irrigation.  An inspection of the nasopharynx confirmed that the adenoids were in fact hypertrophic rubbery cryptic and obstructive.  They were shaved back, flushed with prevertebral fascia with curette.  Hemostasis established with packing followed by electrocautery.  In light of his history of recurring nosebleeds, both sides of the nose were carefully inspected.  A nasal endoscope was used to identify the plexus of bleeding, which was predominantly on the left mid portion of the septum that was controlled with broad superficial cauterization using a suction cautery device.  The bleeding was admittedly a bit of a annoyance.  An additional control was established by infiltrating slowly with a 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine around the perimeter of the bleeding site and then cauterizing the bleeding site itself.  No additional bleeding was then evident.  The oropharynx was reinspected, clots removed, the patient was extubated, taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Discharge will be anticipated later in the day on Lortab plus amoxicillin plus Ponaris nose drops.  Office recheck anticipated if stable and doing well in three to four weeks.","surgery, tonsillitis, cryptic hypertrophic tonsils, tonsillolith, nasal cauterization, adenoid hypertrophy, hypertrophic tonsils, adenoidectomy, nasal, cauterization, hypertrophy, epistaxis, tonsils, hypertrophic, intubation, tonsillectomy"

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.

She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery.","surgery, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, afrin drops, bayonet cautery, cpap, cottle elevator, crowe-davis, freer elevator, obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillectomy, hypertrophy, mouth gag, nasal, nasal passage, nasal septum, nasopharynx, nostrils, palate, pharynx, septal cartilage, septoplasty, sleep apnea, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, hypertrophy of tonsils, anterior tonsillar pillars, soft palate incision, palate incision, tonsillar pillars, incision "

The anterior tonsillar pillar was infiltrated with 1.5 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, as was the left tonsillar pillar.  The right tonsil was grasped with the tenaculum and retracted out of its fossa.  The anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with the #12 knife blade.  The plica semilunaris was incised with the Metzenbaum scissors.  Using the Metzenbaum scissors and the Fisher knife, the tonsil was dissected free of its fossa onto an inferior pedicle around which the tonsillar snare was placed and applied.  The tonsil was removed from the fossa and the fossa packed with a cherry gauze sponge as previously described.  By a similar procedure, the opposite tonsillectomy was performed and the fossa was packed.,Attention was re-directed to the right tonsil.  The pack was removed and bleeding was controlled with the suction Bovie unit.  Bleeding was then similarly controlled in the left tonsillar fossa and the nasopharynx after removal of the packs.

There was a rock in the right ear and it was very deep in the canal, near the drum.  We will remove the foreign body under the same anesthetic.,PROCEDURE:,:  Natalie was placed under general anesthetic by the orotracheal route of administration, under Dr. XYZ and Ms. B.  I looked into the left ear under the microscope, took out a little wax and observed a normal eardrum.  On the right side, I took out some impacted wax and removed the rock with a large suction.  It was actually resting on the surface of the drum but had not scarred or damaged the drum.  The drum was intact with no evidence of middle ear fluid.  The microscope was set aside.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils.  The neck was gently extended and the Crowe-Davis mouth gag inserted.  The tonsils and adenoids were very large.  The uvula was intact.  Adenoidectomy was performed using the adenoid curette with a tonsil sponge placed into the nasopharynx.  Tonsillectomy accomplished by sharp and blunt dissection.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery and the tonsils beds injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.

Suppression was attempted, however, unsuccessful.  She presents today with her thyroid goiter.  A thyroidectomy was indicated at this time secondary to the patient's chronic condition.  Indications, alternatives, risks, consequences, benefits, and details of the procedure including specifically the risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis or paralysis or vocal cord dysfunction and possible trach were discussed with the patient in detail.  She agreed to proceed.  A full informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient presented to ABCD General Hospital on 09/04/2003 with the history was reviewed and physical examinations was evaluated.  The patient was brought by the Department of Anesthesiology, brought back to surgical suite and given IV access and general endotracheal anesthesia.  A 9 cc of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 of epinephrine was infiltrated into the area of pre-demarcated above the suprasternal notch.  Time is allowed for full hemostasis to be achieved.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A #10 blade was then utilized to make an incision in the pre-demarcated and anesthetized area.  Unipolar electrocautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Finger dissection was carried out in the superior and inferior planes.  Platysma was identified and dissected and a subplatysmal plane was created in the superior and inferior, medial and lateral directions using hemostat, Metzenbaum, and blunt dissection.  The strap muscles were identified.  The midline raphe was not easily identifiable at this time.  An incision was made through what appeared to be in the midline raphe and dissection was carried down to the thyroid.  Sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were identified and separated on the patient's right side and then subsequently on the left side.  It was noted at this time that the thyroid lobule on the right side is a bi-lobule.  Kitner blunt dissection was utilized to bluntly dissect the overlying thyroid fascia as well as strap muscles off the thyroid, force in the lateral direction.  This was carried down to the inferior and superior areas.  The superior pole of the right lobule was then identified.  A hemostat was placed in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was placed in this area.  A second Kitner was placed on lateral aspect of the superior pole and the superior pole of the right thyroid was retracted inferiorly.  Careful dissection was then carried out in a very meticulous fashion in the superior lobe and identified the appropriate vessels and cauterized with bipolar or ligated with the suture ligature.  This was carried out until the superior pole was identified.  Careful attention was made to avoid nerve injury in this area.  Dissection was then carried down again bluntly separating the inferior and superior lobes.  The bilobed right thyroid was then retracted medially.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve was then identified and tracked to its insertion.  The overlying vessels of the middle thyroid vein as well as the associated structures were then identified and great attention was made to perform a right careful meticulous dissection to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve off the thyroid.  When it was completed, this lobule was then removed from Berry's ligament.  There was noted to be no isthmus at this time and the entire right lobule was then sent to the Pathology for further evaluation.  Attention was then diverted to the patient's left side.  In a similar fashion, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles were already separated.  Army-Navy as well as femoral retractors were utilized to lateralize the appropriate musculature.  The middle thyroid vein was identified.  Blunt dissection was carried out laterally to superiorly once again.  A hemostat was utilized to make an opening in the cricothyroid groove and a Kitner was then placed in this area.  Another Kitner was placed on the lateral aspect of the superior lobe of the left thyroid and retracted inferiorly.  Once again, a careful meticulous dissection was utilized to identify the appropriate structures in the superior pole of the left thyroid and suture ligature as well as bipolar cautery was utilized for hemostasis.  Once again, a careful attention was made not to injure the nerve in this area.  The superior pole was then freed appropriately and blunt dissection was carried down to lateral and inferior aspects.  The inferior aspect was then identified.  The inferior thyroid artery and vein were then identified and ligated.  The left thyroid was then medialized and the recurrent laryngeal nerve has been identified.  A careful dissection was then carried out to remove the fascial attachments superficial to the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the side as close to the thyroid gland as possible.  The thyroid was then removed from the Berry's ligament and it was then sent to Pathology for further evaluation.  Evaluation of the visceral space did not reveal any bleeding at this time.  This was irrigated and pinpoint areas were bipolored as necessary.  Surgicel was then placed bilaterally.  The strap muscles as well as the appropriate fascial attachments were then approximated with a #3-0 Vicryl suture in the midline.  The platysma was identified and approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture and the subdermal plane was approximated with a #4-0 Vicryl suture.  A running suture consisting of #5-0 Prolene suture was then placed and fast absorbing #6-0 was then placed in a running fashion.  Steri-Strips, Tincoban, bacitracin and a pressure gauze was then placed.  The patient was then admitted for further evaluation and supportive care.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","surgery, thyroid goiter, graves disease, thyroidectomy, total thyroidectomy, dissection, superior, kitner"

The greater saphenous vein was harvested from the right upper leg through interrupted skin incisions and was prepared by ligating all branches with 4-0 silk and flushing with vein solution.  The leg was closed with running 3-0 Dexon subcu, and running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular on the skin, and later wrapped.  A median sternotomy incision was made and the left internal mammary artery was dissected free from its takeoff at the subclavian to its bifurcation at the diaphragm and surrounded with papaverine-soaked gauze.  The sternum was closed.  A right carotid incision was made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carried down to and through the platysma.  The deep fascia was divided.  The facial vein was divided between clamps and tied with 2-0 silk.  The common carotid artery, takeoff of the external and internal carotid arteries were dissected free, with care taken to identify and preserve the hypoglossal and vagus nerves.  The common carotid artery was double-looped with umbilical tape, takeoff of the external was looped with a heavy silk, distal internal was double-looped with a heavy silk.  Shunts were prepared.  A patch was prepared.  Heparin 50 mg was given IV.  Clamp was placed on the beginning of the takeoff of the external and the proximal common carotid artery.  Distal internal was held with a forceps.  Internal carotid artery was opened with 11-blade.  Potts scissors were then used to extend the aortotomy through the lesion into good internal carotid artery beyond.  The shunt was placed and proximal and distal snares were tightened.  Endarterectomy was carried out under direct vision in the common carotid artery and the internal reaching a fine, feathery distal edge using eversion on the external.  All loose debris was removed and Dacron patch was then sutured in place with running 6-0 Prolene suture, removing the shunt just prior to completing the suture line.  Suture line was completed and the neck was packed.,The pericardium was opened.  A pericardial cradle was created.  The patient was heparinized for cardiopulmonary bypass, cannulated with a single aortic and single venous cannula.  A retrograde cardioplegia cannula was placed with a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene into the coronary sinus, and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  An antegrade cardioplegia needle sump was placed in the ascending aorta and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  The ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given antegrade, a total of 5 cc per kg.  This was followed sumping of the ascending aorta and retrograde cardioplegia, a total of 5 cc per kg to the coronary sinus.  The obtuse marginal 1 coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture.  The vein was cut to length.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.  The obtuse marginal 2 was not felt to be suitable for bypass, therefore, the posterior descending of the right coronary was identified and opened, and an end-to-side anastomosis was then performed with running 7-0 Prolene suture to reverse autogenous saphenous vein.  The vein was cut to length.  The mammary was clipped distally, divided and spatulated for anastomosis.  Antegrade and retrograde cold blood potassium cardioplegia was given.

Preoperative imaging studies revealed the above-noted abnormalities. After a detailed review of management considerations with the patient and his wife, he was elected to proceed as noted above.,Operative indications, methods, potential benefits, risks and alternatives were reviewed. The patient and his wife expressed understanding and consented to proceed as above.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, L4-L5 and L5-S1 disk protrusion with configuration as anticipated from preoperative imaging studies. Pedicle screw placement appeared satisfactory with satisfactory purchase and positioning noted at all sites as well as satisfactory findings upon probing of the pedicular tracts at each site. In addition, all pedicle screws were stimulated with findings of above threshold noted at all sites. Spacer snugness and positioning appeared satisfactory. Electrophysiological monitoring was carried out throughout the procedure and remained stable with no undue changes reported.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, After obtaining proper patient identification and appropriate preoperative informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room on a hospital stretcher in the supine position. After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of appropriate monitoring equipment by Anesthesiology as well as placement of electrophysiological monitoring equipment by the Neurology team, the patient was carefully turned to the prone position and placed upon the padded Jackson table with appropriate additional padding placed as needed. The patient's posterior lumbosacral region was thoroughly cleansed and shaved. The patient was then scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual manner. After local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with 1: 200,000 epinephrine solution, a posterior midline skin incision was made extending from approximately L3 to the inferior aspect of the sacrum. Dissection was continued in the midline to the level of the posterior fascia. Self-retaining retractors were placed and subsequently readjusted as needed. The fascia was opened in the midline, and the standard subperiosteal dissection was then carried out to expose the posterior and posterolateral elements from L3-L4 to the sacrum bilaterally with lateral exposure carried out to the lateral aspect of the transverse processes of L4 and L5 as well as the sacral alae bilaterally. _____ by completing the exposure, pedicle screw fixation was carried out in the following manner. Screws were placed in systematic caudal in a cranial fashion. The pedicle screw entry sites were chosen using standard dorsal landmarks and fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Cortical openings were created at these sites using a small burr. The pedicular tracts were then preliminarily prepared using a Lenke pedicle finder. They were then probed and subsequently tapped employing fluoroscopic guidance as needed. Each site was ""under tapped"" and reprobed with satisfactory findings noted as above. Screws in the following dimensions were placed. 6.5-mm diameter screws were placed at all sites. At S1, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally. At L5, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally, and at L4, 40-mm length screws were placed bilaterally with findings as noted above. The rod was then contoured to span from the L4 to the S1 screws on the right. The distraction was placed across the L4-L5 interspace, and the connections were temporarily secured. Using a matchstick burr, a trough was then carefully created slightly off the midline of the left lamina extending from its caudal aspect to its more cranial aspect at the foraminal level. This was longitudinally oriented. A transverse trough was similarly carefully created from the cranial point of the longitudinal trough out to the lateral aspect of the pars against the foraminal level that is slightly caudal to the L4 pedicle. This trough was completed to the level of the ligamentum flavum using small angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs, and this portion of the lamina along with the inferior L4 articular process was then removed as a unit using rongeurs and curettes. The cranial aspect of the left L5 superior articular process was then removed using a small burr and angled curettes and Kerrison rongeurs. A superior laminotomy was performed from the left L5 lamina and flavectomy was then carried out across this region of decompression, working from caudally to cranially and medially to laterally, again using curettes and Kerrison rongeurs under direct visualization. In this manner, the left lateral aspect of the thecal sac passing left L5 spinal nerve and exiting left L4 spinal nerve along with posterolateral aspect of disk space was exposed. Local epidural veins were coagulated with bipolar and divided. Gelfoam was then placed in this area. This process was then repeated in similar fashion; thereby, exposing the posterolateral aspect of the left L5-S1 disk space. As noted, distraction had previously been placed at L4-L5, this was released. Distraction was placed across the L5-S1 interspace. After completing satisfactory exposure as noted, a annulotomy was made in the posterolateral left aspect of the L5-S1 disk space. Intermittent neural retraction was employed with due caution afforded to the neural elements throughout the procedure. The disk space was entered, and diskectomy was carried out in routine fashion using pituitary rongeurs followed by the incremental sized disk space shavers as well as straight and then angled TLIF curettes to prepare the front plate. Herniated portions of the disk were also removed in routine fashion. The diskectomy and endplate preparation were carried out working progressively from the left towards the right aspect of the disk across the midline in routine fashion. After completing this disk space preparation, Gelfoam was again placed. The decompression was assessed and appeared to be satisfactory. The distraction was released, and attention was redirected at L4-L5, where again, distraction was placed and diskectomy and endplate preparation was carried out at this interspace again in similar fashion. After completing the disk space preparation, attention was redirected to L5-S1. Distraction was released at L4-L5 and again, reapplied at L5-S1, incrementally increasing size. Trial spaces were used, and a 10-mm height by 26-mm length spacer was chosen. A medium BMP kit was appropriately reconstituted. A BMP sponge containing morcellated vertebral autograft was then placed into the anterior aspect of the disk space. The spacer was then carefully impacted into position. The distraction was released. The spacer was checked with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. This process was then repeated in similar fashion at L4-L5, again with placement of a 10-mm height by 26-mm length Capstone spacer, again containing BMP and again with initial placement of a BMP sponge with vertebral autograft anteriorly within the interspace. This spacer was also checked again with satisfactory snugness and positioning noted. The prior placement of the spacers and BMP, the wound was thoroughly irrigated and dried with satisfactory hemostasis noted. Surgicel was placed over the exposed dura and disk space. The distraction was released on the right and compression plates across the L5-S1 and L4-L5 interspaces and the connections fully tightened in routine fashion. The posterolateral elements on the right from L4 to S1 were prepared for fusion in routine fashion, and BMP sponges with supplemental vertebral autograft was placed in the posterolateral fusion bed as well as the vertebral autograft in the dorsal aspect of the L4-L5 and L5-S1 facets on the right in a routine fashion. A left-sided rod was appropriated contoured and placed to span between the L4 to S1 screws. Again compression was placed across the L4-L5 and L5-S1 segments, and these connections were fully secured. Thorough hemostasis was ascertained after checking the construct closely and fluoroscopically. The wound was closed using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures to reapproximate the deep paraspinal musculature in the midline. The superficial paraspinal musculature in posterior fashion was closed in the midline using multiple simple interrupted 0-Vicryl sutures. The suprafascial subcutaneous layers were closed using multiple simple interrupted #0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was then closed using staples. Sterile dressings were then applied and secured in place.

Risks, benefits, alternatives of the procedures were discussed in great detail with the patient.  Risks include but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, need for calcium supplementation, tumor recurrence, need for additional treatment, need for thyroid medication, cosmetic deformity, and other.  The patient understood all these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multinodular thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms and bilateral dominant thyroid nodules proven to be benign by fine needle aspiration.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in a operating room table.  After establishing general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation with a 6 Nerve Integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were then tacked with Tegaderm.  The Nerve Integrity monitoring system, endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately.  Essentially a 7 cm incision was employed in the lower skin crease of the neck.  A 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were given.  Shoulder roll was applied.  The patient prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 15-blade was used to make the incision.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal respectively.  The strap muscles were separated in the midline.  As we then turned to the left side where the sternohyoid muscle was separated from the sternothyroid muscle there was a very dense and firm thyroid mass on the left side.  The sternothyroid muscle was transected horizontally.  Similar procedure was performed on the right side.,Attention was then turned to identify the trachea in the midline.  Veins in this area and the pretracheal region were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  Subsequently, attention was turned to dissecting the capsule off of the left thyroid lobe.  Again this was very firm in nature.  The superior thyroid pole was dissected in the superior third artery, vein, and the individual vessels were ligated with a harmonic scalpel.  The inferior and superior parathyroid glands were protected.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in the tracheoesophageal groove.  This had arborized early as a course underneath the inferior thyroid artery to a very small tiny anterior motor branch.  This was followed superiorly.  The level of cricothyroid membrane upon complete visualization of the entire nerve, Berry's ligament was transected and the nerve protected and then the thyroid gland was dissected over the trachea.  A prominent pyramidal level was also appreciated and dissected as well.,Attention was then turned to the right side.  There was significant amount of thyroid tissue that was very firm.  Multiple nodules were appreciated.  In a similar fashion, the capsule was dissected.  The superior and inferior parathyroid glands protected and preserved.  The superior thyroid artery and vein were individually ligated with the harmonic scalpel and the inferior thyroid artery was then ligated close to the thyroid gland capsule.  Once the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified again on this side, the nerve had arborized early prior to the coursing underneath the inferior thyroid artery.  The anterior motor branch was then very fine, almost filamentous and stimulated at 0.5 milliamps, completely dissected toward the cricothyroid membrane with complete visualization.  A small amount of tissue was left at the Berry's ligament as the remainder of thyroid level was dissected over the trachea.  The entire thyroid specimen was then removed, marked with a stitch upon the superior pole.  The wound was copiously irrigated, Valsalva maneuver was given, bleeding points controlled.  The parathyroid glands appeared to be viable.  Both the anterior motor branches that were tiny were stimulated at 5 milliamps and confirmed to be working with the Nerve Integrity monitoring system.,Attention was then turned to burying the Surgicel on the wound bed on both sides.  The strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline using a 3-0 Vicryl suture of the sternothyroid horizontal transection and the strap muscles in the midline were then reapproximated.  The 1/8th inch Hemovac drain was placed and secured with a 3-0 nylon.  The incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.  The patient has a history of keloid formation and approximately 1 cubic centimeter of 40 mg per cubic centimeter Kenalog was injected into the incisional line using a tuberculin syringe and 25-gauge needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room table, and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a good condition.  Upon completion of the case, fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed intact bilateral true vocal fold mobility.","surgery, total thyroidectomy, goiter, multinodular thyroid goiter, multinodular, thyroid nodules, parathyroid glands, thyroid goiter, thyroid artery, thyroidectomy"

She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg.  She was doing very well and was obviously improving.,The swelling was reduced.  A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination.  She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure.  The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  She understood them well.  All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm.  The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width.  Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided.  The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion.  This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides.  At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present.  Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander.  On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately.  I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor.  I then did place adequate tension on the sutures.  Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller.  At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound.  The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin.  The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors.  The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied.,It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained.  Adequate tension was placed in this region.  A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, fasciotomy, subcutaneous, muscle, wound debridement, insertion of tissue expander, compartment syndrome, compartment fasciotomy, lateral wound, medial wound, tension controller, tissue expander, wound, tissue, compartment,"

The runoff vein was dissected out and encircled with the vessel loop as well.  A longitudinal incision was made over the venous anastomosis.  There was a narrowing in the area and slightly the incision was extended more proximally.  There was good back bleeding from the vein as well as bleeding from the more distal vein.  These were occluded with noncrushing DeBakey clamps and the patient was given 5000 units of heparin intravenously.  A #4 Fogarty was used to extract thrombus from the graft systematically until the arterial plug was removed and excellent inflow was established.  There was a narrowing in the mid portion of the venous limb of the graft, which was dilated with a #5 coronary dilator.  The Fogarty catheter was then passed up the vein, but no clot was obtained.  A patch PTFE material was fashioned and was sutured over the graftotomy with running 6-0 Gore-Tex suture.  Clamps were removed and flow established.  A thrill was easily palpable.

He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.,Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.,The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.,The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.

A thoracostomy tube was placed at the bedside with only partial resolution of the pleural effusion.  On CT scan evaluation, there is evidence of an entrapped right lower lobe with loculations.  Decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention for a complete decortication and the patient understands the need for surgery and signed the preoperative informed consent.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department.  Intraoperative bronchoscopy was performed by Dr. Y and evaluation of carina, left upper and lower lobes with segmental evidence of diffuse mucous, thick secretions which were thoroughly lavaged with sterile saline lavage.  Samples were obtained from both the left and the right subbronchiole segments for Gram stain cultures and ASP evaluation.  The right bronchus lower, middle, and upper were also examined and subsegmental bronchiole areas were thoroughly examined with no evidence of masses, lesions, or suspicious extrinsic compressions on the bronchi.  At this point, all mucous secretions were thoroughly irrigated and aspirated until the airways were clear.  Bronchoscope was then removed.  Vital signs remained stable throughout this portion of the procedure.  The patient was re-intubated by Anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube.  At this point, the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion.  At this point, the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with Betadine.  The first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically.  A bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity.  Pictures were taken.  There is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura, encompassing the lung surface, diaphragm, and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax.  At this point, a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization.  With the aid of the thoracoscopic view, a Yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid.  Due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate, there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped.  Due to the extensive nature of the disease, decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion.  Incision was made.  The subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi, which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.  The chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per Anesthesia at our request.  Once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed, a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe, middle, and the right lower lobe.  With the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate, warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to re-expand.  There was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery.,Full lung re-expansion was noted upon re-inflation of the lung.  Two #32 French thoracostomy tubes were placed, one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus.  The chest tubes were secured in place with #0-silk sutures and placed on Pneumovac suction.  Next, the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted CTX sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Next, subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure.  Steri-Strips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room.  The chest tubes were maintained on Pleur-Evac suction for full re-expansion of the lung.  The patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable.  Stat portable chest x-ray is pending.  The patient will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring overnight.","surgery, empyema, total decortication, intraoperative bronchoscopy, intrathoracic cavity, fibrinous exudate, latissimus dorsi, chest tubes, pleural effusion, bronchoscopy, thoracostomy, thoracotomy, decortication, anesthesia, pleural,"

Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.  The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, dacron graft, thoracoabdominal, cerebrospinal, thoracoabdominal aneurysm, running prolene, prolene suture, dissected free, graft, interposition, aneurysm, dacron, cannula, bifurcation, aorta, endotracheal, proleneNOTE"

A time-out process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given.,The patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed.  It included the previous incision.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  Actually, there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura, which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure, and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke.  Thanks to Dr. X's ingenuity, we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after I incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura.  We aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity.  The sample was taken for culture and sensitivity.,Then, at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta __________ towards the heart including his diaphragm.  Once we accomplished that, we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung.  Further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent.,Then, we were left with the trapped lung.  It was trapped by thickened visceral pleura.  This was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively.  Finally, we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened, we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily.  There was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently I was not able to fill.  This area, of course, was very rigid but any surgery in the direction __________ would have caused __________ injury, so I restrained from doing that.  Two large chest tubes were placed.  The cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline.  Then, the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of Vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figure-of-eight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin.,The chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk.  Dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation, he was able to be extubated in the operating room.,Estimated blood loss was about 500 mL.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the ICU in a satisfactory condition.","surgery, total pulmonary decortication, pulmonary decortication, parietal pleurectomy, endotracheal tube, chest retractor, chest tubes, parietal pleura, pleurectomy, empyema, endotracheal, thoracotomy, pleura, chest "

Preoperative evaluation included a CT scan, which showed focal mass.  CT and PET confirmed anterior lesion.  Therefore the patient was seen in our thoracic tumor board where it was recommended to have resection performed with chest wall reconstruction.  In the outpatient setting, the patient was willing to proceed.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient identified correctly.  She was taken to the operating room where an epidural catheter was placed by Anesthesia without difficulty.  She was sedated and intubated with double-lumen endotracheal tube without difficulty.  She was positioned with left side up.  Appropriate pressure points were padded.  The left chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  The skin incision was made in the posterior axillary line, approximately 7th intercostal space with #10 blade, taken down through tissues and Bovie electrocautery.,Pleura was entered.  There was good deflation of the left lung.  __________ port was placed, followed by the 0-degree 10-mm scope with appropriate patient positioning.  Posteriorly a pedunculated 2.5 x 3-cm pleural-based mass was identified on the anterior chest wall.  There were thin adhesions to the pleura, but no invasion of the chest wall that could be identified.  The tumor was very mobile and was on a pedunculated stalk, approximately 1.5 cm.  It was felt that this could be resected without the need of chest wall reconstruction because of the narrow stalk.,Therefore a 2nd port was placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 8th intercostal space in the usual fashion.  Camera was placed through this port.  Laparoscopic scissors were placed through the posterior port, but it was necessary to have another instrument to provide more tension than just gravity.  Therefore because of the need to bring the specimen through the chest wall, a small 3-cm thoracotomy was made, which incorporated the posterior port site.  This was taken down to the subcutaneous tissue with Bovie electrocautery.  Periosteal elevator was used to lift the intercostal muscle off.  The ribs were not spread.  Through this 3-cm incision, both the laparoscopic scissors as well as Prestige graspers could be placed.  Prestige graspers were used to pull the specimen from the chest wall.  Care was taken not to injure the capsule.  The laparoscopic scissors on cautery were used to resect the parietal pleural off of the chest wall.  Care was taken not to transect the stalk.  Specimen came off the chest wall very easily.  There was good hemostasis.,At this point, the EndoCatch bag was placed through the incision.  Specimen was placed in the bag and then removed from the field.  There was good hemostasis.  Camera was removed.  A 24-French chest tube was placed through the anterior port and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  The posterior port site was closed 1st with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion for the intercostal muscle layer, followed by 2-0 closure of the latissimus fascia as well as subdermal suture, 4-0 Monocryl was used for the skin, followed by Steri-Strips and sterile drapes.

She was not able to have her dialysis as routine.  Her potassium was dramatically elevated at 7 the initial evening of anticipated surgery.  Both Surgery and Anesthesia thought this would be too risky to do.  Thus, she was given medications to decrease her potassium and a temporary hemodialysis catheter was placed in the femoral vein noted for her to have dialysis that night as well as this morning.  This morning her predialysis potassium was 6, and thus she was scheduled for surgery after her dialysis.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A transverse incision was made at the region of the venous anastomosis of the graft.  Further dissection was carried down to the catheter.  The vein appeared to be soft and without thrombus.  This outflow did not appear to be significantly impaired.  A transverse incision was made with a #11 blade on the venous limb of the graft near the anastomosis.  Next, a thrombectomy was done using a #4 Fogarty catheter.  Some of the clot and thrombus was removed from the venous limb.  The balloon did hang up in the multiple places along the venous limb signifying some degree of stenosis.  Once removing most of the clots from the venous limb prior to removing the plug, dilators were passed down the venous limb also indicating the area of stenosis.  At this point, we felt the patient would benefit from a curettage of the venous limb of the graft.  This was done and subsequent passes with the dilator and the balloon were then very easy and smooth following the curettage.  The Fogarty balloon was then passed beyond the clot and the plug.  The plug was visualized and inspected.  This also gave a good brisk bleeding from the graft.  The patient was heparinized and hep saline solution was injected into the venous limb and the angle vascular clamp was applied to the venous limb.  Attention was directed up to its anastomosis and the vein.  Fogarty balloon and thrombectomy was also performed well enough into this way.  There was good venous back bleeding following this.  The area was checked for any stenosis with the dilators and none was present.  Next, a #6-0 Prolene suture was used in a running fashion to close the graft.  Just prior to tying the suture, the graft was allowed to flush to move any debris or air.  The suture was also checked at that point for augmentation, which was good.  The suture was tied down and the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues and a #4-0 undyed Vicryl was used in a running subcuticular fashion to approximate the skin edges.  Steri-Strips were applied and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She will be discharged from recovery when stable.  She is to resume her regular dialysis schedule and present for dialysis tomorrow.","surgery, thrombosed, hyperkalemia, thrombectomy, forearm loop graft, venous outflow, chronic renal failure, venous limb, loop graft, forearm loop, limb, forearm, graft, venous, anastomosis, stenosis,"

There was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung.  The patient had a 30-year history of cigarette smoking.  A chest tube was placed at the other hospital, which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor, actually what was thought to be a fecal-like odor.  Then an abdominal CT scan was done, which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal CT.  The patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room, where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.  The patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions, but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out.  This was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline ***** in the bronchus.  Following the bronchoscopy, a double lumen tube was placed, but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day.,The patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment.  Today, the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted.  These were suctioned, but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus.  Eventually, the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that.  The chest tube tract, which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space, but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract.  A second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.  Therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout.  Remarkably, the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line, but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe.  There were many pockets of purulent material, which had a gray-white appearance to it.  There was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe.  The adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time.  There seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension, all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed.  Many cultures were taken from several areas.  The most remarkable finding was a large cavity, which was probably about 11 cm in dimension, containing grayish pus and also caseous-like material, it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue, perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity.,The apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm.,PROCEDURE AND TECHNIQUE:,  With the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract, but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the Thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this.  Therefore, the next incision for Thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved, but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy.  Therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made, entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space.  Quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity.  Specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense.  Suture ligatures of Prolene were required.  When the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity, which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a ""tissue pledget"" of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with Prolene sutures.,Also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14-French Foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated, which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the Foley catheter was removed.  The patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear.  A similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity.  Also on the pulmonary artery repair some ***** material was used and also thrombin, Gelfoam and Surgicel.  After reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline.  As mentioned, biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.  Then two #24 Blake chest tubes were placed, one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk.  One was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex.  These were later connected to water-seal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure.,Good hemostasis was observed.  Sponge count was reported as being correct.  Intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth, sixth, and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out.  Then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib.  Metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture, but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table, so that pericostal sutures were used with #1 Vicryl.  The chest wall was closed with running #1 Vicryl and then 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  The chest tubes were connected to water-seal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.

She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms.  For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic.  She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected.  Second check was made prior to prepping and draping.  Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level.  We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars.  We dissected down carefully to identify the pars.  We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level.  We did this under live fluoroscopy.  We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well.  We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars.  The pars was then drilled out.  We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord.  We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty.  Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further.  Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well.  We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily.  We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material.  We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root.  The Epstein curette removed some more disc material.  Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression.  We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure.  We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure.  Hemostasis was meticulous.  The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied.  Dressing was applied.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  150 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISPOSITION:,  To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home.","surgery, thoracic right-sided discectomy, herniated nucleus pulposus, discectomy, thoracic, herniated,"

After obtaining the informed consent, the patient's posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated above the seventh intercostal space in the midscapular line.  Initially, I tried to use the thoracentesis set after 1% Xylocaine had been infiltrated, but the needle of the system was just too short to reach the pleural cavity due to the patient's very thick chest wall.  Therefore, I had to use a #18 spinal needle, which I had to use almost in its entire length to reach the fluid.  From then on, I proceeded manually to withdraw 2000 mL of a light milky fluid.,The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well, but almost at the end of it she said that she was feeling like fainting and therefore we carefully withdrew the needle.  At that time, it was getting difficult to withdraw fluid anyway and we allowed her to lie down and after a few minutes the patient was feeling fine.  At any rate, we gave her bolus of 250 mL of normal saline and the patient returned to her room for additional hours of observation.  We then thought that if she was doing fine, then we will send her home.,A chest x-ray was performed after the procedure which showed a dramatic reduction of the amount of pleural fluid and then there was no pneumothorax or no other obvious complications of her procedure.,","surgery, malignant pleural effusion, chest wall, pleural effusion, dyspnea, thoracentesis, fluid, pleural, "

After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.

The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin.  She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas.  She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back.  The patient desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal.  Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.,Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered as well as the operating table.  The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot.  The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted.  A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence.  At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum.  A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone.  The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time.  A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone.  An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone.  After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf.  The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area.  Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible.  Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone.  Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone.  The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted.  The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted.  The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed.,Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal.  There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal.  Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal.  The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon.  The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head.  Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly.  At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences.,All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp.  The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted.  The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line.  Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites.  Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated.

Modified Le Fort I osteotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE:, The patient has undergone previous surgical treatment and had a diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome.  Currently our plan is to remove the impacted third molar teeth, to remove a cystic lesion left posterior mandible, to remove 4 second bicuspid teeth as requested by her orthodontist, and to weaken and her maxilla to allow expansion by a modified Le Fort osteotomy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the operating table in supine position.  Following treatment under adequate general anesthesia via the orotracheal route, the patient was prepped and draped in a manner consistent with intraoral surgical procedures.  The oral cavity was suctioned, was drained of fluid and a throat pack was placed.  General anesthesia nursing service was notified and which was removed at the end of the procedure.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine concentration in 1:100,000 was injected into the labial vestibule of the maxilla bilaterally as well as the lateral areas associated with the extractions sites in lower jaw and the left posterior mandible for a total of 11 mL.  A Bovie electrocautery was utilized to make a vestibular incision, beginning in the second molar region of the maxilla superior to the mucogingival junction extending to the area of the cuspid teeth.  Subperiosteal dissection revealed lateral aspect of the maxilla immediately posterior to the second molar tooth where the third molar tooth was identified and was bony crypt.  Following use of Cerebromaxillary osteotome, elevated, and underwent complete removal of the dental follicle.  Secondly, tooth number 4 was removed.  Tooth number 13 was removed, and the opposite third molar tooth was removed through an identical incision on the opposite side.  Surgeon then utilized a #15 saw to make a horizontal osteotomy through the lateral aspect of the maxilla from the target plates, anteriorly to the area of the buttress region cross the anterior maxilla to a point adjacent to the piriform rim, 5 mm superior to the nasal floor, bilaterally Cerebromaxillary osteotome utilized to separate the maxilla from the target placed posteriorly and a 5 mm Tessier osteotome through a vertical incision anteriorly between roots of teeth numbers 8 and 9.  This resulted in the alternate mobilization of the two halves of the maxilla, or to allow expansion.  These wounds were all irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and with antibiotic containing solution, closed with 3-0 chromic suture in running fashion for watertight closure.  Attention was directed to the mandible where the left posterior mandible was approached through a lateral vestibular incision overlying the external oblique ridge and brought anteriorly in an old scar.  The surgeons utilized cautery osteotome to identify a cystic lesion associated with the left posterior mandible, which was approximately 1 cm in width and 2.5 to 3 cm in vertical dimension immediately adjacent to the neurovascular bundle.  This wound was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline and concentrated solution of clindamycin.  Closed primarily with a 3-0 Vicryl suture in running fashion for a watertight closure.  Teeth number 20 and 29 where removed and 3-0 chromic suture placed.  This concluded the procedure.  All cottonoids and other sponges, throat pack were removed.  No complications were encountered.  The aforementioned cystic lesion was sent with specimen no drains were placed.  The blood loss from this procedure was approximately 100 mL.,The patient was returned over the care of the anesthesia where she was extubated in the operating room, taken from the operating room to the recovery room with stable vital signs and spontaneous respirations.","surgery, nevus syndrome, basal cell, mandible, teeth, hyperplasia, cystic lesion, osteotomy, le fort, le fort osteotomy, orotracheal route, bony crypt, watertight, removal of cystic lesion, le fort i osteotomy, aspect of the maxilla, modified le fort, molar tooth, posterior mandible, maxillary, molar, tooth,"

Operative findings demonstrated the same with normal appearing tubes bilaterally.  The right ovary contained a right ovarian cyst.  The left ovary appeared to be within normal limits.  The peritoneal surfaces were noted to be within normal limits.  The bowel was also noted to be within normal limits.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 44-year-old female who had an endometrial ablation done in May, which showed submucosal fibroids.  She had history of anemia and has been on iron therapy.  She started having bleeding three weeks ago with intermittent bouts of flooding.,She desired permanent and definitive therapy and therefore it was felt very appropriate to take the patient for a total abdominal hysterectomy.  The uterus, cervix, and right tube and ovary was sent to pathology for review.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's term.  She was taken to the operating room where a general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was examined under anesthesia with noted findings above.  She was placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife and was then carried down to the underlying layer of the fascia.  With the second knife, the fascia was excised in the midline and extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with the Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up and the underlying rectus muscle was dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline, the peritoneum was identified, entered bluntly and digitally.  Then the peritoneal incision was then extended superior and inferiorly with excellent visualization of the bladder.  The GYN Balfour was then placed.  A Lahey clamp was placed on the fundus of the uterus to pull the uterus into the operative field and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Attention was then turned to the round ligaments bilaterally, which were tented up with Allis clamps and then a hemostat was poked through the avascular portion underneath the round ligament and the #O-tie was passed through and then tied down.  Then the round ligament was transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  The round ligaments were then skeletonized to create a window in the broad ligament.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated through the window created from the round ligaments and then the infundibular ligament on the right was loop tied and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and then transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion.  It was noted to be hemostatic.  Attention was then turned to the left side, in which the uterovarian vessel was isolated and then tied with an #O-tie and then doubly clamped with straight Ochsner clamps, transected and suture ligated with a #0 Vicryl in a Heaney stitch fashion and noted to be hemostatic.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then identified, tented up with Allis clamps, and then the bladder flap was created sharply with a Russian and Metzenbaum scissors.  Then the bladder was deflected off of the underlying cervix with blunt dissection with a moist Ray-Tec sponge down to the level of the cervix.,The uterine vessels were skeletonized bilaterally and then clamped with straight Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated and noted to be hemostatic.  In the similar fashion, the broad ligament down to the level of the caudal ligament, the uterosacral ligaments was clamped with curved Ochsner clamps and transected and suture ligated, and noted to be hemostatic.  The second Lahey clamp was then placed on the cervix.  The cervix was tented up and the pubocervical vesical fascia was transected with a long knife and then the vagina was entered with a double pointed scissors poked through well protecting posteriorly with a large malleable.  The cuff was then outlined.  The vaginal cuff was grasped with a Ochsner clamp and then the cervix, uterus, and the right tube and ovary were transected using the Jorgenson scissors.  The cuff outlined with Ochsner clamps.  The cuff was then painted with a Betadine soaked Ray-Tec sponge and the sponge was placed over the vagina.  The vaginal cuff was then closed with a #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion holding on to the beginning end on the right side as well as incorporating the ipsilateral cardinal ligaments into the cuff angles.  A long Allis was then used to grasp the mid portion of the cuff and a #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed in the mid portion of the cuff and tied down.  At this time, the abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The suture that was used to close the cuff was then used to come back through the posterior peritoneum grabbing the uterosacral ligaments and the mid portion of the cuff, and then tied down to bring the cuff close and together.  Then, the right round ligament was pulled into the cuff and tied down with the #0 Vicryl that was used as a figure-of-eight stitch in the middle of the cuff.  The left round ligament was too small to reach the cuff.  The abdomen was then again copiously irrigated with warm normal saline and noted to be hemostatic.  The peritoneum was then re-peritonealized with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The GYN Balfour and all packing sponges were removed from the abdomen.  Then the abdomen was then once again copiously irrigated and the cuff and incision sites were once again reinspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ______ was placed back into the hollow of the sacrum.  The omentum was then pulled over to top of the bowel and then the peritoneum was then closed with a #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion and then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with staples and dressing applied.  The patient was then examined at the end of the procedure.  The Betadine-soaked sponge was removed from the vagina.  The cuff was noted to be intact without bleeding and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and she was taken to the recovery in stable condition.  The patient will be followed throughout her hospital stay.","surgery, tah, salpingo-oophorectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial ablatio, ochsner clamps, round ligaments, clamps, ligaments, cuff, salpingo, oophorectomy, hysterectomy, uterine, ablation, tubes, abdominal, anesthesia,"

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  Intraabdominal findings revealed a small uterus approximately 2 cm in size.  The ovaries were atrophic consistent with menopause.  The liver margins and stomach were palpated and found to be normal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and administered a spinal anesthesia for postoperative pain control.  She was then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and administered general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and an indwelling Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.  At this point, the patient was evaluated for a possible vaginal hysterectomy.  She was nulliparous and the pelvis was narrow.  After the anesthesia was administered, the patient was repeatedly stooling and therefore because of these two reasons, the decision was made to do an abdominal hysterectomy.  After the patient was prepped and draped, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  The second scalpel was used to dissect out to the underlying layer of fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the rectus fascia was grasped with Ochsners, tented up and underlying layer of rectus muscle was dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  In a similar fashion, the inferior portion of the rectus fascia was tented up, dissected off bluntly as well as with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated bluntly in the midline and the peritoneum was identified and entered with the Metzenbaum.  The peritoneal incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the above findings were noted and the GYN Balfour retractor was placed.  Moist laparotomy sponges were used to pack the bowel out of the operative field.  The bladder blade and the extension for the retractor were then placed.  An Allis was used on the uterus for retraction.  The round ligaments were then identified, clamped with two hemostats and transected and then suture ligated.  The anterior portion of the broad ligament was dissected along vesicouterine resection.  The bladder was then dissected off the anterior cervix and vagina without difficulty.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments on both sides were then doubly clamped using hemostats, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The uterine vessels on both sides were skeletonized and clamped with two hemostats and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was assured.  The cardinal ligaments on both sides were clamped using a curved hemostat, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  Two hemostats were then placed just under the cervix meeting in the midline.  The uterus and cervix were then _______ off using a scalpel.  This was handed and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Using #0 Vicryl suture, the right vaginal cuff angle was closed and affixed to the ipsilateral cardinal ligament.  A baseball stitch was then used to close the cuff to the midline.  The same was done to the left vaginal cuff angle, which was affixed to the ipsilateral and cardinal ligaments.  The baseball stitch was used to close the cuff to the midline.  The hemostats were removed and the cuff was closed and good hemostasis was noted.  The uterosacral ligaments were also transfixed to the cuff and brought out for good support by using a #0 Vicryl suture through each uterosacral ligament and incorporating this into the vaginal cuff.  The pelvis was then copiously irrigated with warm normal saline.  Good support and hemostasis was noted.  The bowel packing was then removed and the GYN Balfour retractor was moved.  The peritoneum was then repaired with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The fascia was then closed using #0 Vicryl in a running fashion, marking the first stitch and first last stitch in a lateral to medial fashion.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure and an Op-Site was placed over this.  The patient was then brought out of general anesthesia and extubated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She will follow up postoperatively as an inpatient.","surgery, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, vaginal vault prolapse, uterosacral ligament vault suspension, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, uterosacral ligament, recurrent dysplasia, uterine procidentia, suture ligated, abdominal, intraepithelial, tah, salpingooophorectomy, hysterectomy, ligament, hemostats, vaginal, "

On bimanual exam, the uterus was enlarged, movable, and anteverted.  The intraabdominal findings revealed normal liver margin, kidneys, and stomach upon palpation.  The uterus was found to be normal in size with evidence of endometriosis on the uterus.  The right ovary and fallopian tube were absent.  The left fallopian tube and ovary appeared normal with evidence of a small functional cyst.  There was evidence of left adnexal adhesion to the pelvic side wall which was filmy, unable to be bluntly dissected.  There were multiple interloop bowel adhesions that were filmy in nature noted.,The appendix was absent.  There did appear to be old suture in a portion of the bowel most likely from a prior procedure.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 45-year-old African-American gravida7, para3-0-0-3, who is here for definitive treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a history of endometriosis.  She did have a laparoscopic ablation of endometriosis on a laparoscopy and also has a history of right salpingo-oophorectomy.  She has tried Lupron and did stop secondary to the side effects.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the Operating Suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and placed in the dorsal supine position.  An indwelling Foley catheter was placed.  With the skin knife, an incision was made removing the old cicatrix.  A Bovie was used to carry the tissue through to the underlying layer of the fascia which was incised in the midline and extended with the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then sharply and bluntly dissected off the superior aspect of the rectus fascia in the superior as well as the inferior aspect using the Bovie.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline using a hemostat and the peritoneum was entered bluntly.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with Metzenbaum scissors with careful visualization of the bladder.  At this point, the intraabdominal cavity was manually explored and the above findings were noted.  A Lahey clamp was then placed on the fundus of the uterus and the uterus was brought to the surgical field.  The bowel was then packed with moist laparotomy sponges.  Prior to this, the filmy adhesions leftover were taken down.  At this point, the left round ligament was identified, grasped with two hemostats, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the broad ligament was dissected down and the lost portion of the bladder flap was created.  The posterior aspect of the peritoneum was also dissected.  At this point, the infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated and three tie of #0 Vicryl was used to isolate the pedicle.  Two hemostats were then placed across the pedicle and this was transected with the scalpel.  This was then suture ligated in Heaney fashion.  The right round ligament was then identified and in the similar fashion, two hemostats were placed across the round ligament and using the Mayo scissors the round ligament was transected and dissected down the broad ligament to create the bladder flap anteriorly as well as dissect the posterior peritoneum and isolate the round ligament.  This was then ligated with three tie of #0 Vicryl.  Also incorporated in this was the remnant from the previous right salpingo-oophorectomy.  At this point, the bladder flap was further created with sharp dissection as well as the moist Ray-Tech to push the bladder down off the anterior portion of the cervix.,The left uterine artery was then skeletonized and a straight Heaney was placed.  In a similar fashion, the contralateral uterine artery was skeletonized and straight Heaney clamp was placed.  These ligaments bilaterally were transected and suture ligated in a left Heaney stitch.  At this point, curved Masterson was used to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex, thus was transected and suture ligated.  Straight Masterson was then used to incorporate the uterosacrals bilaterally and this was also transected and suture ligated.  Prior to ligating the uterine arteries, the uterosacral arteries were tagged bilaterally with #0 Vicryl.  At this point, the roticulator was placed across the vaginal cuff and snug underneath the entire cervix.  The roticulator was then clamped and removed and the staple line was in place.  This was found to be hemostatic.  A suture was then placed through each cuff angle bilaterally and cardinal ligament complex was found to be fixed to each apex bilaterally.  At this point, McCall culdoplasty was performed with an #0 Vicryl incorporating each uterosacral as well as the posterior peritoneum.  There did appear to be good support on palpation.  Prior to this, the specimen was handed off and sent to pathology.  At this point, there did appear to be small amount of oozing at the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis was obtained using a #0 Vicryl in two single stitches.  Good hemostasis was then obtained on the cuff as well as the pedicles.  Copious irrigation was performed at this point with lactate Ringers.  The round ligaments were then incorporated into the cuff bilaterally.  Again, copious amount of irrigation was performed and good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the peritoneum was reapproximated in a single interrupted stitch on the left and right lateral aspects to cover each pedicle bilaterally.  At this point, the bowel packing as well as moist Ray-Tech was removed and while re-approximating the bowel it was noted that there were multiple interloop bowel adhesions which were taken down using the Metzenbaum scissors with good visualization of the underlying bowel.  Good hemostasis was obtained of these sites as well.  The sigmoid colon was then returned to its anatomic position and the omentum as well.  The rectus muscle was then reapproximated with two interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion from lateral to medial meeting in the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #3-0 plain in a running suture.  The skin was then re-approximated with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular closure.  This was dressed with an Op-Site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle were correct x2.  After the procedure, the patient was extubated and brought out of general anesthesia.

At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.

The patient with continued symptoms of pelvic pain and hypermenorrhea and desired definitive surgical treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY: , Uterus is anteverted and boggy with a very narrow introitus with a palpable left adnexal mass.,On laparotomy, the uterus was noted to be slightly enlarged with fibroid change as well as a hemorrhagic appearing left adnexal mass.  The bowel, omentum, and appendix had a normal appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.  At the end of the procedure, the sponge that was pushed into the vagina previously was removed and hemostasis was appreciated vaginally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  Specimens include uterus, cervix, left fallopian tube, and ovary.",

Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.,2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter,3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid,throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.","surgery, intrathecal, catheter, paraspinous, cerebrospinal, synchromed infusion pump, synchromed pump catheter, synchromed pump, paraspinous muscle, cerebrospinal fluid, tunneling device, infusion pump, subcutaneous tissue, infusion, synchromed, pump, incision,"

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.  The EndoGIA was used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovaries at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one was reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area was then re-peritonized and copious amounts of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was removed as well as all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrants with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the peritoneum as well as abdominal rectus muscle.  The edges of the fascia were grasped at both corners and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied and Betadine soaked sponge was removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault was wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.

The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.

She saw her dentist in Sacaton before Thanksgiving who placed her on antibiotics and told her to return to the clinic for multiple teeth extractions.  The patient neglected to return to the dentist until this weekend for IV antibiotics and definitive treatment.  She noticed on Friday that her face was starting to swell up a little bit and it progressively got worse.  The patient was admitted to the hospital on Monday for IV antibiotics.  Oral surgery was consulted today to aid in the management of the increased facial swelling and tooth pain.  The patient was worked up preoperatively by anesthesia and Oromaxillary Facial Surgery.  It was determined that she would benefit from being having multiple teeth removed and drainage of the facial abscess under general anesthesia.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and laid on the operating room table on supine fashion.  ASA monitors were attached as stated.  General anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with a nasal endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual oromaxillary facial surgery fashion.,An 18-gauze needle of 20 mL syringe was used to aspirate the pus out of the right buccal space.  This pus was then cultured and sent to micro lab for cultures and sensitivities.  Approximately 7 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:1000 epinephrine was injected in the maxillary vestibule and palate.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take affect a moist latex sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to throat pack throughout the case.  Mouth rinse was then poured into the oral cavity.  The mucosa was scrubbed with a tooth brush and peridex was evacuated with suction.  Using a #15 blade a clavicular incision from tooth #5 back to 1 with tuberosity release was performed.,A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed and approximately 6 mL of pus was instantly drained from the buccal space.  It was noted on exam that the tooth #1 was fractured off to the gum line with gross decay.  Tooth #2, 3, 4, and 5 had pus leaking from the clavicular epithelium and had rampant decay on tooth #2 and 3 and some mobility on teeth #4 and 5.  It was decided that teeth #1 through 5 would be surgically removed to ensure that all potential teeth causing the abscess were removed.  Using a rongeur both buccal bone and the tooth 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were surgically removed.  The extraction sites were curetted with curettes and the bone was smoothed with the rongeur and the bone file.  Dissection was then carried further up in the canine space and the face was palpated extra orally from the temporalis muscle down to the infraorbital rim and more pus was expressed.  This site was then irrigated with copious amounts of sterile water.  There was still noted to be induration in the buccal mucosa so #15 blade was used anterior to Stensen duct.  A 2 cm incision was made and using a Hemostat blunt dissection in to the buccal mucosa was performed.  A little-to-no pus was received.  Using a half-inch Penrose the drain was placed up on the anterior border of the maxilla and zygoma and sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon suture.  Remainder of the flap was left open to drain.  Further examination of the floor of mouth was soft.  The lateral pharynx was nonindurated or swollen.  At this point, the throat pack was removed and OG tube was placed and the stomach contents were evacuated.  The procedure was then determined to be over.  The patient was extubated, breathing spontaneously, and transferred to the PACU in excellent condition.","surgery, cultures, buccal, teeth, canine, pacu, teeth extractions, oromaxillary facial, facial surgery, buccal space, throat pack, buccal mucosa, surgical removal, canine's base, necrotic teeth, cpt code, infection, oral, mucosa, anesthesia, facial, pus, toothache, "

She subsequently had repeat chest x-rays and CT scans and was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion.  She had the appropriate inflammatory workup for pericardial effusion, however, it was nondiagnostic.  Also, during that time, she had become significantly more short of breath.  A dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed, which was negative with the exception of the pericardial effusions.  She had no tamponade physiology.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , For therapeutic and diagnostic management of this symptomatic pericardial effusion.  Risks, benefits, and alternative measures were discussed with the patient.  Consent was obtained for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4 cm incision was created in the midline above the xiphoid.  Dissection was carried down through the fascia and the xiphoid was resected.  The sternum was retracted superiorly the pericardium was identified and pericardial fat was cleared off the pericardium.  An #0 silk suture was then placed into the pericardium with care taken not to enter the underlying heart.,This suture was used to retract the pericardium and the pericardium was nicked with #15 blade under direct visualization.  Serous fluid exited through the pericardium and was sent for culture, cytology, and cell count etc.  A section of pericardium was taken approximately 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm and was removed.  The heart was visualized and appeared to be contracting well with no evidence of injury to the heart.  The pericardium was then palpated.  There was no evidence of studding.  A right angle chest tube was then placed in the pericardium along the diaphragmatic of the pericardium and then brought out though a small skin incision in the epigastrium.  It was sewn into place with #0 silk suture.  There was some air leak of the left pleural cavity, so a right angle chest tube was placed in the left pleural cavity and brought out through a skin nick in the epigastrium.  It was sewn in the similar way to the other chest tube.  Once again, the area was inspected and found to be hemostatic and then closed with #0 Vicryl suture for fascial stitch, then #3-0 Vicryl suture in the subcutaneous fat, and then #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Chest tubes were placed on 20 cm of water suction.

316, Superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion repair., Surgery, Superior Labrum Lesions Repair ,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic.,Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution.  A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed.,We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution.  An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint.,We found that the articular surface was in good condition.  The biceps was found to be intact.  There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps.  Pictures were taken.  No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted.  The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears.  Pictures were again taken.,We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff.  A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this.  Pictures were taken.  We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution.  It was drained.  Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture.  A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint.  Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed.,The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.

There was a large amount of tissue obtained on the procedure.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum and due to the patient already being dilated approximately 2 cm, no cervical dilation was needed.  A size 12 straight suction curette was used and connected to the suction and was placed in the cervix and a suction curettage was performed.  Two passes were made with the suction curettage.  Next, a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a small amount of tissue and this was followed by third suction curettage and then a final sharp curettage was performed, which revealed a good uterine cry on all sides of the uterus.  After the procedure, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The cervix was seemed to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was removed.  The patient was given 0.25 mg of Methergine IM approximately half-way through the procedure.  After the procedure, a second bimanual exam was performed and the patient's uterus had significantly decreased in size.  It is now approximately eight to ten-week size.  The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition after she was cleaned.  She will be discharged on today.

319, Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty., Surgery, Suboccipital Craniectomy  ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma.  The patient is having surgery for resection.  There was significant cerebellar peduncle compression.  The tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex.  The case took 12 hours.  This was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right acoustic neuroma.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room.  General anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion.  After appropriate lines were placed, the patient was placed in Mayfield 3-point head fixation, hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area.  A time-out was settled with nursing and anesthesia, and the head was shaved, prescrubbed with chlorhexidine, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone.  Once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum, the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with Leksell and insertion with Kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.  The dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion, the cisterna magna was drained, which nicely relaxed the cerebellum.  The dura leaves were held back with the 4-0 Nurolon.  The microscope was then brought into the field, and under the microscope, the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated.  Laterally, the arachnoid was very thick.  This was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified.  The tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa.  Initially two retractors were used, one on the tentorium and one inferiorly.  The arachnoid was taken down off the tumor.  There were multiple blood vessels on the surface, which were bipolared.  The tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the Cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion.  This was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum; however, as the tumor was able to be debulked, the edge began to be mobilized.  The redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor.  Working inferiorly and then superiorly, the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th, 10th or 11th nerve complex.  It was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex.  The brainstem was identified above the complex.  Similarly, inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain.  Attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex.  There were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein, which were coming right into this area.  The lateral pontine vein was maintained.  Microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain, and then working inferiorly, the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem.  A number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane.  This then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed.  A number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve.  Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out.  The nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this.  The tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off.  The Cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus.  The tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus.  At this point, the capsule was so redundant, it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus.  There was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.  All the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem.  Dr. X then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus.,I then scrubbed back into case once Dr. X had completed removing this portion of the tumor.  There was no tumor remaining at this point.  I placed some Norian in the porus to seal any air cells, although there were no palpated.  An intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly.  There was no bleeding.  The nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level, but it did not stimulate at this time.  The dura was then closed with 4-0 Nurolons in interrupted fashion.  A muscle plug was used over one area.  Duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by Hemaseel.  Gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out.  The wound was then irrigated thoroughly.  O Vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia, 3-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissue, and 3-0 nylon on the skin.,The patient was extubated and taken to the ICU in stable condition.","surgery, suboccipital, craniectomy, microscope, cranioplasty, acoustic neuroma, cerebellar peduncle, nerve complex, brainstem, nurolon, cavitron, kerrison, leksell, lateral pontine vein, suboccipital craniectomy, nerve, tumor"

At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered.  Since that time, the patient has defervesced.  Her white count is slowly coming down.  Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia.  The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics.  The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed.  We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band.  These deep stitches were then removed.  We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess.  The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery.  We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin.  Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself.  We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint.  Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline.  We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially.  We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon.  We placed a sterile dressing.  We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft.,PLAN:  ,Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours.

All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered.  The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After landmarks were identified, approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine were injected into the skin and subcuticular tissues and the right neck posterior head of the sternocleidomastoid.  Locator needle was used to correctly cannulate the right internal jugular vein.  Multiple attempts were made and the right internal jugular vein was unable to be cannulized.,Therefore, we prepared for a right subclavian approach.  The angle of the clavicle was found and a #22 gauge needle was used to anesthetize approximately 5 cc of 1% lidocaine in skin and subcuticular tissues along with the periosteum of the clavicle.  A Cook catheter needle was then placed and ________ the clavicle in the orientation aimed toward the sternal notch.  The right subclavian vein was then accessed.  A guidewire was placed with a Cook needle and then the needle was subsequently removed and a #11 blade scalpel was used to nick the skin.  A dilator sheath was placed over the guidewire and subsequently removed.  The triple lumen catheter was then placed over the guidewire and advanced to 14 cm.  All ports aspirated and flushed.

He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.,OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: ,A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.",

She is blood type AB -ve with antibody screen negative and is also rubella immune, VDRL nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and HIV nonreactive.  She does have a history of sickle cell trait.  She presented to Labor and Delivery Triage at 40 and 3/7th weeks gestation with complaint of contractions every ten minutes.  She also stated that she has lost her mucous plug.  She did have fetal movement, noted no leak of fluid, did have some spotting.  On evaluation of triage, she was noted to be contracting approximately every five minutes and did have discomfort with her contractions.  She was evaluated by sterile vaginal exam and was noted to be 4 cm dilated, 70% effaced, and -3 station.  This was a change from her last office exam, at which she was 1 cm to 2 cm dilated.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was admitted to Labor and Delivery for expected management of labor and AROM was performed and the amniotic fluid was noted to be meconium stained.  After her membranes were ruptured, contractions did increase to every two to three minutes as well as the intensity increased.  She was given Nubain for discomfort with good result.,She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live born female at 11:37 with meconium stained fluid as noted from ROA position.  After controlled delivery of the head, tight nuchal cord was noted, which was quickly double clamped and cut and the shoulders and body were delivered without difficulty.  The infant was taken to the awaiting pediatrician.  Weight was 2870 gm, length was 51 cm.  The Apgars were 6 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes.  There was initial neonatal depression, which was treated by positive pressure ventilation and the administration of Narcan.,Spontaneous delivery of an intact placenta with a three-vessel cord was noted at 11:45.  On examination, there were no noted perineal abrasions or lacerations.  On vaginal exam, there were no noted cervical or vaginal sidewall lacerations.  Estimated blood loss was less than 250 cc.

Endotracheal intubation carried out by Dr. X. The patient's right ear was carefully prepped and then draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Slow infiltration of the external canal accomplished with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  The earlobe was also infiltrated with the same solution.  A limited incision was made in the earlobe harvesting a small bit of fat from the earlobe that was diced and the donor site closed with interrupted sutures of 5-0 nylon.  This could later be removed in bishop.  A reinspection of the ear canal was accomplished.  A 65 Beaver blade was used to make incision both at 12 o'clock and at 6 o'clock.  Jordan round knife was used to incise the tympanomeatal flap with an adequate cuff for later reapproximation.  Elevation was carried down to the fibrous annulus.  An annulus elevator was used to complete the elevation beneath the annular ligament.  The tympanic membrane and the associated flap rotated anteriorly exposing the ossicular chain.  Palpation of the malleus revealed good mobility of both it and incus, but no movement of the stapes was identified.  Palpation with a fine curved needle on the stapes itself revealed no movement.  A house curette was used to takedown portions of the scutum with extreme care to avoid any inadvertent trauma to the chorda tympani.  The nerve was later hydrated with a small curved needle and an additional fluid to try to avoid inadvertent desiccation of it as well.  The self-retaining speculum holder was used to get secure visibility and argon laser then used to create rosette on the posterior cruse.  The stapes superstructure anteriorly was mobilized with a right angle hook at the incostapedial joint and the superstructure could then be downfractured.  The fenestration created in the footplate was nearly perfect for placement of the piston and therefore additional laser vaporization was not required in this particular situation.  A small bit of additional footplate was removed with a right angle hook to accommodate the 0.6 mm piston.  The measuring device was used and a 4.25 mm slim shaft wire Teflon piston chosen.  It was placed in the middle ear atraumatically with a small alligator forceps and was directed towards the fenestration in the footplate.  The hook was placed over the incus and measurement appeared to be appropriate.  A downbiting crimper was then used to complete the attachment of the prosthesis to the incus.  Prosthesis is once again checked for location and centering and appeared to be in ideal position.  Small pledgets of fat were placed around the perimeter of the piston in an attempt to avoid any postoperative drainage of perilymph.  A small pledget of fat was also placed on the top of the incudo-prosthesis junction.  The mobility appeared excellent.  The flap was placed back in its normal anatomic position.  The external canal packed with small pledgets of Gelfoam and antibiotic ointment.  She was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in a stable condition with discharge anticipated later this day to Bishop.  Sutures will be out in a week and a recheck in Reno in four to five weeks from now.","surgery, bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss, argon laser assisted, conductive hearing losses, intubation, argon, stapedectomy, otosclerosis, canal, earlobe, prosthesis, pledgets, laser"

The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results.,INDICATION:,  This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention.,COMMENTS: , This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient.  Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed.  The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome.  The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area.  Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure.  When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired.,THORACIC SPINE: , With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine.  The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure.  With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand.  The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure.  The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2.  Cavitation was achieved.,LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS:,  With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal.  Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver.  Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature.  Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver.  The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time).  This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity.  Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance.,With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc.  The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished.  Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees.  This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally.  These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity.,By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance","surgery, fibromyositis, myalgia, segmental dysfunction, sacro-iliitis, spinal manipulation under anesthesia, lumbar segmental dysfunction, informed consent, iliac joints, spinal manipulation, sacro iliitis, lower extremity, spinal, mua, cephalad, dysfunction, segmental, lumbar, "

Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area.,2.  Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area.,DRAINS:,  None.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet.  Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder.  A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery.  Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches.  Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery.  Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection.  This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule.  This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window.  After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision.  An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum.  This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment.  EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury.  The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone.  Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified.  This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen.  Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis.  Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer.  Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur.  Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained.  Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided.  Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided.  The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene.  Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia.  A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.

Posterior elements to include laminotomy-foraminotomy and decompression of the nerve roots.,IMPLANT: , Sofamor Danek (Medtronic) Legacy 5.5 Titanium system.,MONITORING: , SSEPs, and the EPs were available.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 12-year-old female, who has had a very dysmorphic scoliosis.  She had undergone a workup with an MRI, which showed no evidence of cord abnormalities.  Therefore, the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with Surgery with the mother, to include infections, bleeding, nerve injuries, vascular injuries, spinal cord injury with catastrophic loss of motor function and bowel and bladder control.  I also discussed ___________ and need for revision surgery.  The mom understood all this and wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent general anesthetic.  She then had lines placed, and was then placed in a prone position.  Monitoring was then set up, and it was then noted that we could not obtain motor-evoked potentials.  The SSEPs were clear and were compatible with the preoperative, but no preoperative motors had been done, and there was a concern that possibly this could be from the result of the positioning.  It was then determined at that time, that we would go ahead and proceed to wake her up, and make sure she could move her feet.  She was then lightened under anesthesia, and she could indeed dorsiflex and plantarflex her feet, so therefore, it was determined to go ahead and proceed with only monitoring with the SSEPs.,The patient after being prepped and draped sterilely, a midline incision was made, and dissection was carried down.  The dissection utilized a combination of hand instruments and electrocautery and dissected out along the laminae and up to the transverse processes.  This occurred from T2-L2.  Fluoroscopy was brought in to verify positions and levels.  Once this was done, and all bleeding was controlled, retractors were then placed.  Attention was then turned towards placing screws first on the left side.  Lumbar screws were placed at the junction of the transverse process and the facets under fluoroscopic guidance.  The area was opened with a high speed burr, and then the track was defined with a blunt probe, and a ball-tipped feeler was then utilized to verify all walls were intact.  They were then tapped, and then screws were then placed.  This technique was used at L1 and L2, both the right and left.  At T12, a direct straight-ahead technique was utilized, where the facet was removed, and then the position was chosen under the fluoroscopy, and then it was spurred, the track was defined and then probed and tapped, and it was felt to be in good position.  Two screws, in the right and left were placed at T12 as well, reduction screws on the left.  The same technique was used for T11, where right and left screws were placed as well as T10 on the left.  At T9, a screw was placed on the left, and this was a reduction screw.  On the left at T8, a screw could not be placed due to the dysmorphic nature of the pedicle.  It was not felt to be intact; therefore, a screw was left out of this.  On the right, a thoracic screw was placed as well as at 7 and 6.  This was the dysmorphic portion of this.  Screws were attempted to be placed up, they could not be placed, so attention was then turned towards placing pedicle hooks.  Pedicle hooks were done by first making a box out of the pedicle, removing the complete pedicle, feeling the undersurface of the pedicle with a probe, and then seating the hook.  Upgoing pedicle hooks were placed at T3, T4, and T5.  A downgoing laminar hook was placed at the T7 level.  Screws had been placed at T6 and T7 on the right.  An upgoing pedicle hook was also placed at T3 on the right, and then, downgoing laminar hooks were placed at T2.  This was done by first using a transverse process, lamina finders to go around the transverse process and then ___________ laminar hooks.  Once all hooks were in place, spinal osteotomies were performed at T7-T8 and T8-T9.  This was the level of the kyphosis, to bring her back out of her kyphoscoliosis.  First the ligamentum flavum was resected using a large Kerrisons.  Next, the laminotomy was performed, and then a Kerrison was used to remove the ligamentum flavum at the level of the facet.  Once this was accomplished, a laminotomy was performed by removing more of the lamina, and to create a small wedge that could be closed down later to correct the kyphosis.  This was then brought out with resection of bone out to the foramen, doing a foraminotomy to free up the foramen on both sides.  This was done also between the T8-T9.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was then placed.  Next, we observed, and measured and contoured.  The rods were then seated on the left, and then a derotation maneuver was performed.  Hooks had come loose, so the rod was removed on the left.  The hooks were then replaced, and the rod was reseated.  Again, it was derotated to give excellent correction.  Hooks were then well seated underneath, and therefore, they were then locked.  A second rod was then chosen on the right, and was measured, contoured, and then seated.  Next, once this was done, the rods were locked in the midsubstance, and then the downgoing pedicle hook, which had been placed at T7 was then helped to compress T8 as was the pedicle screw, and then this compressed the osteotomy sites quite nicely.  Next, distraction was then utilized to further correct at the spine, and to correct on the left, the left concave curve, which gave excellent correction.  On the right, compression was used to bring it down, and then, in the lower lumbar areas, distraction and compression were used to level out L2.  Once this was done, all screws were tightened.  Fluoroscopy was then brought in to verify L1 was level, and the first ribs were also level, and it gave a nice balanced spine.  Everything was copiously irrigated, ___________.  Next, a wake-up test was performed, and the patient was then noted to flex and extend the knees as well as dorsiflex and plantar flex both the feet.  The patient was then again sedated and brought back under general anesthesia.  Next, a high-speed burr was used for decortication.  After final tightening had been accomplished, and then allograft bone and autograft bone were mixed together with 10 mL of iliac crest aspirate and were placed into the wound.  The open canal areas had been protected with Gelfoam.  Once this was accomplished, the deep fascia was closed with multiple figure-of-eight #1's, oversewn with a running #1, _________ were then placed in the subcutaneous spaces which were then closed with 3-0 Vicryl, and then the skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Drains had been placed in the subcutaneous layer x2.  The patient during the case had no changes in the SSEPs, had a normal wake-up test, and had received Ancef and clindamycin during the case.  She was taken from the operating room in good condition.","surgery, osteotomy, laminotomy-foraminotomy, sofamor danek, sseps, spinal fusion, transverse processes, pedicle hooks, pedicle, laminotomy, hooks, screws, instrumentation, decompression, scoliosis, sofamor, foraminotomy, spinal"

This was found to be moderately corrected.  Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy.,INDICATIONS: , The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis.  He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression.  Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits.  They wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  General anesthesia was induced without incident.  He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics.  Appropriate lines were then placed.  He had a neuromonitoring performed as well.,He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up.  An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib.  Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed.  The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later.,The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally.  This allowed for entry into the pleural space.  The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap.  The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine.,Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies.  This required cauterization of the segmental vessels.  Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed.  These were performed from T11-L3.  This was over 5 levels.  Disks and endplates were then removed.  Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces.  The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine.  This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature.,The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity.  The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well.  Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl.  This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape.,The patient was then rotated into a prone position.  The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion.,Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5.  The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision.  Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis.  The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split.  This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes.  Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine.  These were placed at L4 and L5.  The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum.  This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur.  Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft.,Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed.  These were placed from L3-T3.,Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned.  This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side.  The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine.  This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature.,Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin.  This was done using pulsed lavage.,The wound was then closed in layers.

337, Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.  Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3., Surgery, Skull Base Reconstruction ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.,PROCEDURE: , Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion.  The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen.  The neck was prepped as well.  After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl.  A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle.  After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible.  The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared.  The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out.  The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen.  The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen.  The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis.  A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use.  I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb.  It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube.  The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made.  I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion.  Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy.  For details, please see his operative note.,After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap.  A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm.  The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath.  Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle.  The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin.  The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction.  The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion.  The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel.  The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges.  The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck.  The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique.  Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes.  Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well.  There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case.  The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax.  The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl.  I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place.  The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself.  The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.,The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples.  The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened.  The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, rectus abdominis myocutaneous, skull base defect, squamous cell carcinoma, skull base, squamous cell, rectus sheath, abdominis, muscle, rectus, sheath"

The patient had a fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy performed in the office which demonstrated the mass and confirmed also on CT scan.  The patient also has had this right upper lid skin lesion which appears to be a cholesterol granuloma for numerous months.  It appears to be growing in size and is irregularly bordered.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed to the patient, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was turned to 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  The right upper eyelid skin lesion was injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 1 cc total.  After this, the patient's bilateral nasal passages were then packed with cocaine-soaked cottonoids of 10% solution of 4 cc total.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the right upper lid skin was then first cut around the skin lesion utilizing a Superblade.  After this, the skin lesion was then grasped with a ________ in the  superior aspect and the skin lesion was cut and removed in the subcutaneous plane utilizing Westcott scissors.  After this, the ________ was then hemostatically controlled with monopolar cauterization.  The patient's skin was then reapproximated with a running #6-0 Prolene suture.  A Mastisol along with a single Steri-Strip was in place followed Maxitrol ointment.  Attention then was drawn to the nasopharynx.  The cocaine-soaked cottonoids were removed from the nasal passages bilaterally and zero-degree otoscope was placed all the way to the patient's nasopharynx.  The patient had a severely deviated nasal septum more so to the right than the left.  There appeared to be a spur on the left inferior aspect and also on the right posterior aspect.  The nasopharyngeal mass appeared polypoid in nature almost lymphoid tissue looking.  It was then localized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 of approximately 3 cc total.  After this, the lesion was then removed on the right side with the XPS blade.  The torus tubarius was noted on the left side with the polypoid lymphoid tissue involving this area completely.  This area was taken down with the XPS blade.  Prior to taking down this lesion with the XPS, multiple biopsies were taken with a straight biter.  After this, a cocaine-soaked cottonoid was placed back in the patient's left nasal passage region and the nasopharynx and the attention was then drawn to the right side.  The zero-degree otoscope was placed in the patient's right nasal passage and all the way to the nasopharynx.  Again, the XPS was then utilized to take down the nasopharyngeal mass in its entirety with some involvement overlying the torus tubarius.  After this, the patient was then hemostatically controlled with suctioned Bovie cauterization.  A FloSeal was then placed followed by bilateral Merocels and bacitracin-coated ointment.  The patient's Meroceles were then tied together to the patient's forehead and the patient was then turned back to the Anesthesia.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent home and with instructions to followup approximately in one week.

Open reduction of nasal septum and nasal pyramid fracture with osteotomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  Under affects of general endotracheal anesthesia, head and neck were prepped and draped with pHisoHex solution and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  A gull-wing incision was drawn over the forehead scalp.  Hair was removed along the suture line and incision was made to skin and subcutaneous tissue of the scalp down to, but not including the pericranium.  An inferiorly based forehead flap was then elevated to the superior orbital rim.  The depression of the anterior table of the frontal sinus was noted.  An incision was made more posterior creating an inferiorly based pericranial flap.  The supraorbital nerve was axing from the supraorbital foramen and the supraorbital foramen was converted to a groove in order to allow further inferior displacement and positioning of the forehead flap.  These allowed exposure of the medial orbital wall on the right side.  The displaced fractures of the right medial orbital wall were repositioned through coronal approach.  ,Further reduction of the nose intranasally also allowed the ethmoid fracture to be aligned more appropriately in the medial wall.  The anterior table fracture was satisfactorily reduced.  Multiple 1.3-mm screws and plate fixation were utilized to recontour the anterior forehead.  A mucocele was removed from the frontal sinus and there was no significant destruction of the posterior wall.  A sinus seeker was utilized and passed into the nasofrontal duct without difficulty.  It was felt that the frontal sinus obliteration would not be necessary.,At this point, the pericranial flap was folded in a fan-folded fashion on top of the plate and screw and hardware and fixed in position with the sutures to remain better contour of the forehead.  At this point, the nose was significantly shifted to the left and an open reduction of the nasal fracture was performed by osteotomies, which were made medially, laterally, and percutaneous transverse osteotomy of the nasal bone on the right side.  There is significant depression of the nasal bone on the left side.  A medial osteotomy was performed on the left side mobilizing nasal pyramid satisfactorily.  There is a high septal deviation, which would not allow complete correction of the deviation.  It was felt that this would best be left for a later date.  Open reduction rhinoplasty could be performed with spread of cartilage grafting in order to straighten the septum high dorsally.  Local infiltration anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the conjunctival fornix of the right lower eyelid as well as the inferior orbital rim.  An incision was made in the palpebral conjunctiva and capsular palpebral fascia beneath the tarsal plate preseptal approach to the inferior orbital rim was performed in this fashion.  Dissection proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim and subperiosteal dissection was performed over the orbital floor.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  There was entrapped periorbita, which was released to the fractures, which were repositioned, but not fixed in position.  The forced ductions were performed, which demonstrated release of the periorbit satisfactorily.  The conjunctival incision was closed with an interrupted simple 6-0 plain gut suture.  The nasal pyramid was satisfactorily mobilized as well as the nasal septum and brought back to midline position with the help of a Boies elevator for the septum.  The coronal incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for the galea and deep subcutaneous tissue and the skin closed with interrupted surgical staples.  Nose was dressed with Steri-Strips.  Mastisol Orthoplast splint was prepared after the Doyle splints were placed in the nose and secured with 3-0 Prolene suture and the nose packed with two Kennedy Merocel sponges.  A supportive mildly compressive dressing with fluffs, Kerlix, and 4-inch Ace were applied.

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility.  The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.,FINDINGS: , At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room.  A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach.  A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum.  Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field.  The left testicle was examined.  A large spermatocele was noted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele.  Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis.  Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis.  Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord.  The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors.  Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends.  Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position.  The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic.  Attention was then turned to the right side.  The vas was palpated in the scrotum.  A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field.  A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat.  Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery.  Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum.  A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision.  Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain.

He is almost 3 years old.  He presented with 2 months of irritability, vomiting, and increasing seizures.  CT scan was not conclusive, but shuntogram shows no flow through the shunt.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with his head turned to the left.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped on the head, neck, chest and abdomen with ChloraPrep.  Incisions were infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000.  He received oxacillin.,He was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,The frontal incision was reopened and extended along the valve.  Subcutaneous sharp dissection with Bovie cautery was done to expose the shunt parts.  I separated the ventricular catheter from the valve, and this was a medium pressure small contour Medtronic valve.  There was some flow from the ventricular catheter, but not as much as I would expect.  I removed the right-angled clip with a curette and then pulled out the ventricular catheter, and there was gushing of CSF under high pressure.  So, I do believe that the catheter was obstructed, although inspection of the old catheter holes did not show any specific obstructions.  A new Codman BACTISEAL catheter was placed through the same hole.  I replaced it several times because I wanted to be sure it was in the cavity.  It entered easily and there was still just intermittent flow of CSF.  The catheter irrigated very well and seemed to be patent.,I tested the distal system with an irrigation filled feeding tube, and there was excellent flow through the distal valve and catheter.  So I did not think it was necessary to replace those at this time.  The new catheter was trimmed to a total length of 8 cm and attached to the proximal end of the valve.  The valve connection was secured to the pericranium with a #2-0 Ethibond suture.  The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  The shunt pumped and refilled well.  The wound was then closed with #4-0 Vicryl interrupted galeal suture and Steri-Strips on the skin.  It was uncertain whether this will correct the problem or not, but we will continue to evaluate.  If his abdominal pressure is too high, then he may need a different valve.  This will be determined over time, but at this time, the shunt seemed to empty and refill easily.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Blood loss was minimal.  None replaced.","surgery, bactiseal, bactiseal catheter, codman bactiseal, blocked ventriculoperitoneal shunt, ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt revision, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, catheter, ventriculoperitoneal, ventricular, shunt"

The right frontal area and right retroauricular area was shaved and then the head, neck, chest and abdomen were prepped and draped out in the routine manner.  The old scalp incision was opened with a Colorado needle tip and the old catheter was identified as we took the Colorado needle tip over the existing ventricular catheter, right over the sleeve on top of it and when that was entered, the CSF poured out around the ventricular catheter.  The ventricular catheter was then disconnected from the reservoir and endoscopically explored.  We saw it was blocked up proximally.  The catheter was a little adherent and required some freeing up with coagulation and on twisting of the ventricular catheter, I was able to free up the ventricular catheter, and endoscopically inserted a new Bactiseal ventricular catheter.  The catheter went down to the septum and I could see both the right and left lateral ventricles and elected to pass it into the right lateral ventricle.  It irrigated out well.  There was minimal amount of bleeding, but not significant.  The distal catheter system was tested.  There was good distal run off.  Therefore, a linear skin incision was made in the retroauricular area.  Tunneling was performed between the two incisions and a ProGAV valve set to an opening pressure of 10 with a 1-5 shunt assist was brought through the subgaleal tissue, connected to the distal catheter and a flushing reservoir was interposed between the burr hole site ventricular catheter and the ProGAV valve.  All connections were secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  Careful attention was made to make sure that the ProGAV was in the right orientation.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin, closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened, extubated and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, chloraprep, distal shunt revision, colorado needle tip, colorado needle, progav valve, shunt revision, ventricular catheter, catheter, shunt, ventricular,"

The patient was taken to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old female who has had increased pain in to her right shoulder.  X-rays as well as an MRI showed a severe arthritic presentation of the humeral head with mild arthrosis of the glenoid.  She had an intact rotator cuff being at a young age and with potential of glenoid thus it was felt that a hemi-resurfacing was appropriate for her right shoulder focusing in the humeral head.  All risks, benefits, expectations and complications of surgery were explained to her in detail including nerve and vessel damage, infection, potential for hardware failure, the need for revision surgery with potential of some problems even with surgical intervention.  The patient still wanted to proceed forward with surgical intervention.  The patient did receive 1 g of Ancef preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operating table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The patient was moved to a beach chair position.  All extremities were well padded.  Her head was well padded to the table.  Her right upper extremity was draped in sterile fashion.  A saber incision was made from the coracoid down to the axilla.  Skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the cephalic vein was retracted as well as all neurovascular structures were retracted in the case.  Dissecting through the deltopectoral groove, the subscapularis tendon was found as well as the bicipital tendon, 1 finger breadth medial to the bicipital tendon an incision was made.  Subscapularis tendon was released.  The humeral head was brought in to; there were large osteophytes that were removed with an osteotome.  The glenoid then was evaluated and noted to just have mild arthrosis, but there was no need for surgical intervention in this region.  A sizer was placed.  It was felt that size 5 was appropriate for this patient, after which the guide was used to place the stem and pin.  This was placed, after which a reamer was placed along the humeral head and reamed to a size 5.  All extra osteophytes were excised.  The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were intact.  Next, the excess bone was removed and irrigated after which reaming of the central portion of the humeral head was performed of which a trial was placed and showed that there was adequate fit and appropriate fixation.  The arm had excellent range of motion.  There are no signs of gross dislocation.  Drill holes were made into the humeral head after which a size 5 Copeland hemi-resurfacing component was placed into the humeral head, kept down in appropriate position, had excellent fixation into the humeral head.  Excess bone that had been reamed was placed into the Copeland metal component, after which this was tapped into position.  After which the wound site was copiously irrigated with saline and antibiotics and the humeral head was reduced and taken through range of motion; had adequate range of motion, full internal and external rotation as well as forward flexion and abduction.  There was no gross sign of dislocation.  Wound site once again it was copiously irrigated with saline antibiotics.  The subscapularis tendon was approximated back into position with #2 Ethibond after which the bicipital tendon did have significant tear to it; therefore it was tenodesed in to the pectoralis major tendon.  After which, the wound site again was irrigated with saline antibiotics after which subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with staples.  A sterile dressing was placed.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic and transferred to hospital gurney to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.","surgery, degenerative joint disease, hemi-resurfacing, biomet copeland, shoulder hemi resurfacing, humeral, head, degenerative, glenoid, subscapularis, antibiotics, resurfacing, tendon, shoulder,"

The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest.","surgery, ventriculoatrial shunt, endoscopic proximal shunt revision, endoscopic proximal shunt, portnoy ventricular catheter, shunt malfunction, shunt revision, ventricular catheter, shunt, endoscopic, ventricular, proximal, catheter,"

The occipital area was shaven bilaterally and then the areas of the prior scalp incisions were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine after routine prepping and draping.  Both U-shaped scalp incisions were opened exposing both the left and the right ventricular catheters as well as the old low pressure reservoir, which might have been leading to the coaptation of the ventricles.  The patient also had a right subtemporal depression, which was full preoperatively.  The entire old apparatus was dissected out.  We then cut both the ventricular catheters and secured them with sutures so that __________ could be inserted.  They were both inspected.  No definite debris were seen.  After removing the ventricular catheters, the old tracts were inspected and we could see where there was coaptation of the ventricles against the ventricular catheter.  On the right side, we elected to insert the Portnoy ventricular catheter and on the left a new Bactiseal catheter was inserted underneath the corpus callosum in a different location.  The old valve was dissected out and the proGAV valve with a 2-0 shunt assist was inserted and secured with a 2-0 Ethibond suture.  The proGAV valve was then connected to a Bactiseal distal tubing, which was looped in a cephalad way and then curved towards the left burr hole site and then the Portnoy catheter on the right was secured with a right-angled sleeve and then interposed between it and the left burr hole site with a flushing reservoir.  All connections secured with 2-0 Ethibond suture and a small piece of Bactiseal tubing between the flushing reservoir and the connector, which secured the left Bactiseal tubing to the two other Bactiseal tubings one being the distal Bactiseal tubing going towards the proGAV valve, which was set to an opening pressure of 8 and the other one being the Bactiseal tubing, which was going towards the flushing reservoir.,All the wounds were irrigated out with bacitracin and then closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the deep layers and Monocryl for the skin, followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.

The patient had a marked dorsal hump, which was both bony and cartilaginous in nature.,2.  The patient had marked hypertrophy of his nasalis muscle bilaterally contributing to the soft tissue dorsal hump.,3.  The patient had a C-shaped deformity to the left before he had tip ptosis.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who is status post blunt trauma to the nose approximately 9 months with the second episode 2 weeks following and suffered a marked dorsal deformity.  The patient was evaluated, but did not complain of nasal obstruction, and his main complaint was his cosmetic deformity.  He was found to have a C-shaped deformity to the left as well as some tip ptosis.  The patient was recommended to undergo an open septorhinoplasty to repair of this cosmetic defect.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After obtaining a full consent from the patient, identified the patient, prepped with Betadine, brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  The appropriate Esmarch was placed; and after adequate sedation, the patient was subsequently intubated without difficulty.  The endotracheal tube was then secured, and the table was then turned clockwise to 90 degrees.  Three Afrin-soaked cottonoids were then placed in nasal cavity bilaterally.  The septum was then injected with 3 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the subperichondrial plane bilaterally.  Then, 50 additional mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then injected into the nose in preparation for an open rhinoplasty.,Procedure was begun by first marking a columellar incision.  This incision was made using a #15 blade.  A lateral transfixion incision was then made bilaterally using a #15 blade, and then, the columellar incision was completed using iris scissors with care not to injure the medial crura.  However, there was a dissection injury to the left medial crura.  Dissection was then taken in the subperichondrial plane over the lower lateral cartilages and then on to the upper lateral cartilage.  Once we reached the nasal bone, a Freer was used to elevate the tissue overlying the nasal bone in a subperiosteal fashion.  Once we had completed exposure of the bony cartilaginous structures, we appreciated a very large dorsal hump, which was made up of both a cartilaginous and bony portions.  There was also an obvious fracture of the right upper lateral cartilage.  There was also marked hypertrophy what appeared to be in the nasalis muscle in the area of the dorsal hump.  The skin was contributing to the patient's cosmetic deformity.  In addition, we noted what appeared to be a small mucocele coming from the area of the fractured cartilage on the right upper lateral cartilage.  This mucocele was attempted to be dissected free, most of which was removed via dissection.  We then proceeded to remove takedown of the dorsal hump using a Rubin osteotome.  The dorsal hump was taken down and passed off the table.  Examination of the specimen revealed the marking amount of scar tissue at the junction of the bone and cartilage.  This was passed off to use later for possible onlay grafts.  There was now a marked open roof deformity of the cartilage and bony sprue.  A septoplasty was then performed throughout and a Kelly incision on the right side.  Subperichondrial planes were elevated on the right side, and then, a cartilage was incised using a caudal and subperichondrial plane elevated on the left side.  A 2 x 3-cm piece of the cardinal cartilage was then removed with care to leave at least 1 cm dorsal and caudal septal strut.  This cartilage was passed down the table and then 2 columellar strut grafts measuring approximately 15 mm in length were then used and placed to close the bony and cartilaginous open roof deformities.  The spreader grafts were sewn in place using three interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures placed in the horizontal fashion bilaterally.  Once these were placed, we then proceeded to work on the bony open roof.  Lateral osteotomies were made with 2-mm osteotomes bilaterally.  The nasal bones were then fashioned medially to close the open roof deformity, and this reduced the width of the bony nasal dorsum.  We then proceeded to the tip.  A cartilaginous strut was then fashioned from the cartilaginous septum.  It was approximately 15 mm long.  This was placed, and a pocket was just formed between the medial crura.  This pocket was taken down to the nasal spine, and then, the strut graft was placed.  The intradermal sutures were then placed using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture to help to provide more tip projection and definition.  The intradermal sutures were then placed to help to align the nasal tip.  The cartilage strut was then sutured in place to the medial crura after elevating the vestibular skin off the medial crura in the area of the plane suturing.  Prior to the intradermal suturing, the vestibular skin was also taken off in the area of the dome.,The columellar strut was then sutured in place using interrupted 5-0 PDS suture placed in a horizontal mattress fashion with care to help repair the left medial crural foot.  The patient had good tip support after this maneuver.  We then proceeded to repair the septal deformity created by taking down the dorsal hump with the Rubin osteotome.  This was done by crushing the remaining cartilage in the morcellizer and then wrapping this crushed cartilage in endogen, which is a radiated collagen.  The autogenous cartilage was wrapped in endogen in a sandwich fashion, and then, a 4-0 chromic suture was placed through this to help with placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,The dorsal onlay was then sewn into position, and then, the 4-0 chromic suture was brought out through this externally to help the superior placement of the dorsal onlay graft.  Once we were happy with the position of the dorsal onlay graft, the graft was then sutured in place using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing sutures inferiorly just above the superior edge of the lower lateral cartilages.  Once we were happy with the placement of this, we did need to take down some of the bony dorsal hump laterally, and this was done using a #6 and then followed with a #3 push grafts.  This wrapping was performed prior to placement of the dorsal onlay graft.,I went through content with the dorsal onlay graft and the closure of the roof deformities as well as placement of the columellar strut, we then felt the patient could use a bit more tip projection; and therefore, we fashioned a radiated rib into a small octagon; and this was sutured in place over the tip using two interrupted 5-0 PDS sutures.,At this point, we were happy with the test results, although the patient did have significant amount of fullness in the dorsal hump area due to soft tissue thick and fullness.  There do not appear to be any other pathology causing the patient dorsal hump and therefore, we felt we have achieved the best cosmetic result at this point.  The septum was reapproximated using a fast-absorbing 4-0 suture and a Keith needle placed in the mattress fashion.  The Kelly incision was closed using two interrupted 4-0 fast-absorbing gut suture.  Doyle splints were then placed within the nasal cavity and secured to the inferior septum using a 3-0 monofilament suture.  The columellar skin was reapproximated using interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures, and the marginal incision of the vestibular skin was closed using interrupted 4-0 chromic sutures.,At the end of the procedure, all sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct.  A Denver external splint was then applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated, and transported to Anesthesia Care Unit in good condition.",

He has had a history of similar onset.  Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered.  The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity.  There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.

354," Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.", Surgery, Selective Coronary Angiography & Angioplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.","surgery, non-st-elevation mi, selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty, calcified plaque, coronary angiography, st elevation, stenosis, lad, coronary, selective, angiography, angioplasty, balloon, vessel, stent, "

There is also evidence of bilateral internal as well as external nasal valve collapse.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman who had undergone a previous septorhinoplasty after significant trauma in his 20s.  He now presents with significant upper airway resistance and nasal obstruction and is unable to tolerate a CPAP machine.  Therefore, for repair of the above-mentioned deformities including the internal and external nasal valve collapse as well as straightening of the deviated septum, the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with him included but not limited to bleeding, infection, septal perforation, need for further surgeries, external deformity, and he desired to proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and laid supine upon the OR table.  After the induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the nose was decongested using Afrin-soaked pledgets followed by the injection of % lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine in the submucoperichondrial planes bilaterally.  Examination revealed significant deviation of the nasal septum and the bony cartilaginous junction as well as the large septal spur along the floor.  The caudal septum appeared to be now in adequate position.  There was evidence that there had been a previous caudal septal graft on the right nares and it was decided to leave this in place.  Following the evaluation of the nose, a hemitransfixion incision was made on the left revealing a large septal spur consisting primarily down on the floor of the left nostril creating nearly a picture of the vestibular stenosis on the side.  Very carefully, the mucoperichondrial flaps were elevated over this, and it was excised using an osteotome taking care to preserve the 1.5 cm dorsal and caudal strap of the nasal septum and keep it attached to the nasal spine.  Very carefully, the bony cartilaginous junction was identified and a small piece of the bone, where the spur was, was carefully removed.  Following this, it was noted that the cartilaginous region was satisfactory in quantity as well as quality to perform adequate grafting procedures.  Therefore, attention was turned to harvesting the right-sided auricular cartilage, which was done after the region had adequately been prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Postauricular incision using a #15 blade, the area of the submucoperichondrial plane was elevated in order to preserve the nice lining and identifiable portion of the cartilage taking care to preserve the ridge of the helix at all times.  This was very carefully harvested.  This area had been injected previously with 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine.  Following this, the cartilage was removed.  It was placed in saline, noted to be fashioned in the bilateral spreader graft and alar rim graft as well as a small piece of crush which was used to be placed along the top of the dorsal irregularity.  The spreader grafts were sutured in place using submucoperichondrial pockets.  After an external septorhinoplasty approach had been performed and reflection of the skin and soft tissue envelope had been performed, adequately revealing straight septum with significant narrowing with what appeared to be detached perhaps from his ipsilateral cartilages rather from his previous surgery.  These were secured in place in the pockets using a 5-0 PDS suture in a mattress fashion in two places.  Following this, attention was turned to placing the alar rim grafts where pockets were created along the caudal aspect of the lower lateral cartilage and just along the alar margin.  Subsequently, the alar rim grafts were placed and extended all the way to the piriform aperture.  This was sutured in place using a 5-0 self-absorbing gut suture.  The lower lateral cartilage has had some inherent asymmetry.  This may have been related to his previous surgery with some asymmetry of the dome; however, this was left in place as he did not desire any changes in the tip region, and there was adequate support.  An endodermal suture was placed just to reenforce the region using a 5-0 PDS suture.  Following all this, the area was closed using a mattress 4-0 plain gut on a Keith needle followed by the application of ***** 5-0 fast-absorbing gut to close the hemitransfixion incision.  Very carefully, the skin and subcutaneous tissue envelopes were reflected.  The curvilinear incision was closed using a Vicryl followed by interrupted 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The marginal incisions were then closed using 5-0 fast-absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed and secured down using a nylon suture.  They had ointment also placed on them.  Following this, nasopharynx was suctioned.  There were no further abnormalities noted and everything appeared to be in nice position.  Therefore, an external splint was placed after the application of Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was awakened in the operating room.  He was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, nasal septal deviation, nasal septal, auricular cartilage, nasal, nasal obstruction, nasal valve, septoplasty, submucoperichondrial, upper airway, internal nasal valve, external nasal valve, hemitransfixion incision, revision septoplasty, septal spur, valve collapse, auricular, cartilage, collapse, septum, valve, "

After adequate anesthesia via endotracheal intubation, the nose was prepped with Afrin nasal spray.  After this was done, 1% Xylocaine with 100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in both sides of the septum and the mucoperichondrium.  After this, the sinus endoscope at 25-degrees was then used to examine the nasal cavity in the left nasal cavity and staying lateral to the middle turbinate.  A 45-degree forceps then used to open up the maxillary sinus.  There was some prominent tissue and just superior to this, the anterior ethmoid was opened.  The 45-degree forceps was then used to open the maxillary sinus ostium.  This was enlarged with backbiting rongeur.  After this was done, the tissue found in the ethmoid and maxillary sinus were removed and sent to pathology and labeled as left maxillary sinus mucosa.  After this was done, attention was then turned to the right nasal cavity staying laterally to the middle turbinate.  There was noted to have prominence in the anterior ethmoidal area.  This was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  This mucosa was then removed from the anterior area.  The maxillary sinus ostium was then opened with 45-degree forceps.  Tissue was removed from this area.  This was sent as right maxillary mucosa.  After this, the backbiting rongeur was then used to open up the ostium and enlarge the ostium on the right maxillary sinus.  Protecting the eyes with wet gauze and using KTP laser at 10 watts, the sinus endoscope was used for observation and the submucosal resection was done of both inferior turbinates as well as anterior portion of the middle turbinates bilaterally.  This was to open up to expose the maxillary ostium as well as other sinus ostium to minimize swelling and obstruction.  After this was completed, a septoplasty was performed.  The incision was made with a #15 blade Bard-Parker knife.  The flap was then elevated, overlying the spur that was protruding into the right nasal cavity.

Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.

The patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years.  He has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins.  It was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure including intractable pain.  He gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,  The left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region.,The vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee.  Multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly.  Additionally, there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was marked preoperatively in the Preanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, placed in the supine position.  The patient underwent general endotracheal intubation.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline.  A diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left.  A self-retaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified.  The vein was isolated with a right angle.  The vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified.  These were ligated with #3-0 silk suture.  The dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction.  This was identified and #0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between.  The proximal suture was tied down.  Distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein.  An incision was created at the level of the knee.  The distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with #0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated.  The distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location.  The device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity.  Next, attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.  Multiple incisions were created with a #15 blade scalpel.  The incisions were carried down with electrocautery.  Next, utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat, the tissue was spread until the vein was identified.  The vein was then followed to T3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed.  Additionally, some segments were removed.  The stripping approach would be vein stripping device.  Multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated and/or removed.  Occasionally, dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat.  Bleeding was controlled with direct pressure.  All incisions were then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures and/or #4-0 Vicryl sutures.,The femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple #3-0 Vicryl sutures and closed with a running #4-0 subcuticular suture.  The leg was then cleaned, dried, and then Steri-Strips were placed over the incisions.  The leg was then wrapped with a sterile Kerlix.  Once the Kerlix was achieved, an Ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit extubated in stable condition.  He will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.","surgery, varicose veins, saphenous vein, stripping, ligation, vein stripping, lower extremity, saphenous, varicose, vein, ligated, "
363, Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.  Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot., Surgery, Scarf Bunionectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot.,ANESTHESIA:,  IV sedation with local.,HISTORY: , This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion.  The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes.  The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time.  Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously.  The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.  Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then lowered to the operating field.,A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery.  A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially.  Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well.  Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully.  The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule.  The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree.  Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx.  Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition.  Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head.  In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected.  Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well.  Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head.  Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal.  A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well.  Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral.  After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made.  This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone.  Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially.  The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone.  Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction.  Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit.  The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex.  Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved.  Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut.  Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked.  Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap.  Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened.  Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved.  Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite.  Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted.  Based on this, a lateral release was performed.  The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace.  The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected.  Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament.  Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment.  The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline.  After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers.  The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture.  Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing.  The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg.  The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day.  The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling.  The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation.  The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend.  The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office.  The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that.  The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise.  X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this.","surgery, hallux abductovalgus deformity, scarf bunionectomy, metatarsal, bunion, hallux abductovalgus, metatarsophalangeal joint, dorsally, foot, bone, abductovalgus "

The liver margin and bowel appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 7 cm.,The cervix was serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A #20 Hank dilator was left in place.  The sterile speculum was then removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately a 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made through the patient's previous scar.  The Veress needle was placed and gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and the camera was placed with the above findings noted.  Two 5 mm step trocars were placed, one 2 cm superior to the pubic bone along the midline and the other approximately 7 cm to 8 cm to the left at the level of the umbilicus.  The Endoloop was placed through the left-sided port.  A grasper was placed in the suprapubic port and put through the Endoloop and then a portion of the left tube was identified and grasped with a grasper.  A knuckle of tube was brought up with the grasper and a #0 Vicryl Endoloop synched down across this knuckle of tube.  The suture was then cut using the endoscopic shears.  The portion of tube that was tied off was removed using a Harmonic scalpel.  This was then removed from the abdomen and sent to Pathology.  The right tube was then identified and in a similar fashion, the grasper was placed through the loop of the #0 Vicryl Endoloop and the right tube was grasped with the grasper and the knuckle of tube was brought up into the loop.  The loop was then synched down.  The Endoshears were used to cut the suture.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to remove that portion of tube.  The portion of the tube that was removed from the abdomen was sent to Pathology.  Both tubes were examined and found to have excellent hemostasis.  All instruments were then removed.  The 5 mm ports were removed with good hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar was removed.  The fascia of the infraumbilical incision was reapproximated with an interrupted suture of #3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of Marcaine was injected at the incision site.  The vulsellum tenaculum and cervical dilator were then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

Informed consent was obtained. The patient received IV antibiotics including Ancef and Levaeuin prior to surgery. The patient was brought to the operating room and placud in the supine position, where (s)he wad prepped and draped in the routine fashion. A wire lid speculum was carefully placed to provide exposure. A two-armed 7 mm scleral laceration was seen in the supranasal quadrant. The laceration involved the sclera and the limbus in this area. There was a small amount of iris tissue prolapsed in the wound. The Westcott scissors and 0.12 forceps were used to carefully dissect the conjunctiva away from the wound to provide exposure. A cyclodialysis spatula was used to carefully reposit the prolapsed iris tissue back into the anterior chamber. The anterior chamber remained formed and the iris tissue easily resumed its normal position. The pupil appeared round. An 8-0 nylon suture was used to close the scleral portion of the laceration. Three sutures were placed using the 8-0 nylon suture. Then 9-0 nylon suture was used to close the limbal portion of the wound. After the wound appeared closed, a Superblade was used to create a paracentesis at approximately 2 o'clock. BSS was injected through the paracentesis to fill the anterior chamber. The wound was checked and found to be watertight. No leaks were observed. An 8-0 Vicryl suture was used to reposition the conjunctiva and close the wound. Three 8-0 Vicryl sutures were placed in the conjunctiva. All scleral sutures were completely covered. The anterior chamber remained formed and the pupil remained round and appeared so at the end of the case. Subconjunctival injections of Ancef and dexamethasone were given at the end of the case as well as Tobradex ointment. The lid speculum was carefully removed. The drapes were carefully removed.

Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice.  Otherwise, the uterus, left tube and ovary, bowel, liver margins, appendix, and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits.  There was no noted blood in the pelvis.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:,  The patient is a 26-year-old G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night, which has been increasing in intensity.  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room.  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting.  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge.  There was no fevers or chills.  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending.  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst, questionable hemorrhagic.  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits.  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound.  Therefore, it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomy.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix.  The cervix was grasped at 12 o'clock position with a single-toothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field.  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 3.5 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed.  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold.  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp.  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures.  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  Then, a #11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope.  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above.  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a #12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization.  Then, a grasper was used to untorse the ovary.  Then, a #12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system.  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic.  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag.  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag.  Therefore, a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bag.,There was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst.  This was a clear yellow fluid.  Then, the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port.  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary.  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port.  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was clear and clean.  ,Pictures were obtained.  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a #0-vicyrl and UR6.  Two figure-of-eight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed.  Therefore, the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic.  Therefore, the camera was removed.  All instruments were removed.  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank #12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed.  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with #0-Vicryl and UR6.  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dressings were changed.  The weighted speculum was removed from the patient's cervix.  The cervix noted to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the Recovery in stable condition.",

He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, radiation cystitis, voiding dysfunction, retropubic prostatectomy, salvage radiation therapy, salvage cystectomy, indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, omental pedicle flap, ligasure, gia, stapler, gia stapler, vicryl sutures, radiation therapy, silk sutures, bladder, therapy, sutures, endotracheal, "

Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position.  Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel.,At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue.  Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis.  Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized.  At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated.  There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable.  There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted.  The articular surface could be visualized.  The biceps tendon was intact.  There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface.  The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well.  At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture.  It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure.  The capsule was also reflected posterior.  At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized.  It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact.  The humeral head was evaluated.  There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head.  At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head.  The arm was adequately positioned.  An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut.  This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck.  This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed.  At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized.  The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10.  Under direct visualization, this was performed easily.  At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins.  This was then removed.  A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured.  It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement.  At this point, the trial component was removed.  Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut.  The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization.  All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself.  This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point.  The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced.,The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion.  Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular.  The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity.  This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear.  This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire.  After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition.","surgery, glenohumeral rotator cuff, arthroscopy, degenerative joint disease, shoulder hemiarthroplasty, rotator, cuff, subscapular, shoulder, "

Repair of rotator cuff through mini-arthrotomy.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient's glenohumeral joint was completely clear, other than obvious tear of the rotator cuff.  The midportion of this appeared to be complete, but for the most part, this was about a 60% rupture of the tendon.  This was confirmed later when the bursal side was opened up.  Note, the patient also had abrasion of the coracoacromial ligament under the anterolateral edge of the acromion.  He did not have any acromioclavicular joint pain or acromioclavicular joint disease noted.,PROCEDURE:,  He was given an anesthetic, examined, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion in a beach-chair position.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  The shoulder was instilled with fluid from posteriorly, followed by the arthroscope.  Arthroscopy was then carried out in standard fashion using a 30-degree Dionic scope.  With the scope in the posterior portal, the above findings were noted, and an anterior portal was established.  A curved shaver was placed for debridement of the tear.  I established this was about a 60-70% tear with a probable complete area of tear which was very small.  There were no problems at the biceps or the rest of the joint.  The subacromial space showed findings, as noted above, and a thorough subacromial decompression was carried out with a Bovie, rotary shaver, and bur.  I did not debride the acromioclavicular joint.  The lateral portal was then extended to a mini-arthrotomy, and subacromial space was entered by blunt dissection through the deltoid.  The area of weakness of the tendon was found, and was transversely cut, and findings were confirmed.  The diseased tissue was removed, and the greater tuberosity was abraded with a rongeur.  Tendon-to-tendon repair was then carried out with buried sutures of 2-0 Ethibond, giving a very nice repair.  The shoulder was carried through a range of motion.  I could see no evidence of impingement.  Copious irrigation was carried out.  The deltoid deep fascia was anatomically closed, as was the superficial fascia.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well.","surgery, rotator cuff tear, mini-arthrotomy, repair of rotator cuff, arthroscopic subacromial decompression, arthroscopic subacromial, cuff tear, subacromial space, subacromial decompression, mini arthrotomy, acromioclavicular joint, rotator cuff, arthroscopic, decompression, acromioclavicular, impingement, rotator, cuff,"

Left conchal cartilage harvest (CPT 21235).,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This patient is an otherwise healthy male who had a previous nasal fracture.  During his healing, perioperatively he did sustain a hockey puck to the nose resulting in a saddle-nose deformity with septal hematoma.  The patient healed status post rhinoplasty as a result but was left with a persistent saddle-nose dorsal defect.  The patient was consented for the above-stated procedure.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient did have approximately 12 mL of Lidocaine with epinephrine 1% with 1:100,000 infiltrated into the nasal soft tissues.  In addition to this, cocaine pledgets were placed to assist with hemostasis.,At this point, attention was turned to the left ear.  Approximately 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissues of the conchal bulb.  Betadine was utilized for preparation.  A 15 blade was used to incise along the posterior conchal area and a Freer elevator was utilized to lift the soft tissues off the conchal cartilage in a submucoperichondrial plane.  I then completed this along the posterior aspect of the conchal cartilage, was transected in the concha cavum and concha cymba, both were harvested.  These were placed aside in saline.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar electrocauterization.  Bovie electrocauterization was also employed as needed.  The entire length of the wound was then closed with 5-0 plain running locking suture.  The patient then had a Telfa placed both anterior and posterior to the conchal defect and placed in a sandwich dressing utilizing a 2-0 Prolene suture.  Antibiotic ointment was applied generously.,Next, attention was turned to opening and lifting the soft tissues of the nose.  A typical external columella inverted V gull-wing incision was placed on the columella and trailed into a marginal incision.  The soft tissues of the nose were then elevated using curved sharp scissors and Metzenbaums.  Soft tissues were elevated over the lower lateral cartilages, upper lateral cartilages onto the nasal dorsum.  At this point, attention was turned to osteotomies and examination of the external cartilages.,The patient did have very broad lower lateral cartilages leading to a bulbous tip.  The lower lateral cartilages were trimmed in a symmetrical fashion leaving at least 8 mm of lower lateral cartilage bilaterally along the lateral aspect.  Having completed this, the patient had medial and lateral osteotomies performed with a 2-mm osteotome.  These were done transmucosally after elevating the tract using a Cottle elevator.  Direct hemostasis pressure was applied to assist with bruising.,Next, attention was turned to tip mechanisms.  The patient had a series of double-dome sutures placed into the nasal tip.  Then, 5-0 Dexon was employed for intradomal suturing, 5-0 clear Prolene was used for interdomal suturing.  Having completed this, a 5-0 clear Prolene alar spanning suture was employed to narrow the superior tip area.,Next, attention was turned to dorsal augmentation.  A Gore-Tex small implant had been selected, previously incised.  This was taken to the back table and carved under sterile conditions.  The patient then had the implant placed into the super-tip area to assist with support of the nasal dorsum.  It was placed into a precise pocket and remained in the midline.,Next, attention was turned to performing a columella strut.  The cartilage from the concha was shaped into a strut and placed into a precision pocket between the medial footplate of the lower lateral cartilage.  This was fixed into position utilizing a 5-0 Dexon suture.,Having completed placement of all augmentation grafts, the patient was examined for hemostasis.  The external columella inverted gull-wing incision along the nasal tip was closed with a series of interrupted everting 6-0 black nylon sutures.  The entire marginal incisions for cosmetic rhinoplasty were closed utilizing a series of 5-0 plain interrupted sutures.,At the termination of the case, the ear was inspected and the position of the conchal cartilage harvest was hemostatic.  There was no evidence of hematoma, and the patient had a series of brown Steri-Strips and Aquaplast cast placed over the nasal dorsum.  The inner nasal area was then examined at the termination of the case and it seemed to be hemostatic as well.,The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.  He was charged to home on antibiotics to prevent infection both from the left ear conchal cartilage harvest and also the Gore-Tex implant area.  He was asked to follow up in 4 days for removal of the bolster overlying the conchal cartilage harvest.","surgery, nasal deformity, rhinoplasty, conchal cartilage harvest, conchal bulb, conchal, submucoperichondrial, gull-wing incision, gore-tex, gull wing incision, lower lateral cartilages, revision rhinoplasty, nasal dorsum, cartilage harvest, conchal cartilage, cartilage, nasal, deformity, hemostasis, columella, harvest, cartilages"

Nasal endoscopy.,2.  Partial rhinectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS: , This is an 81-year-old gentleman who underwent septorhinoplasty many years ago.  He also has a history of a skin lesion, which was removed from the nasal ala many years ago, the details of which he does not recall.  He has been complaining of tenderness and induration of his nasal tip for approximately two years and has been treated unsuccessfully for folliculitis and cellulitis of the nasal tip.  He was evaluated by Dr. A, who performed the septorhinoplasty, and underwent an intranasal biopsy, which showed histologic evidence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  The preoperative examination shows induration of the nasal tip without significant erythema.  There is focal tenderness just cephalad to the alar crease.  There is no lesion either externally or intranasally.,PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  Following induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the left nose was decongested with Afrin.  He was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  The left nasal cavity was examined by anterior rhinoscopy.  The septum was midline.  There was slight asymmetry of the nares.  No lesion was seen within the nasal cavity either in the area of the intercartilaginous area, which was biopsied by Dr. A, the septum, the lateral nasal wall, and the floor.  The 0-degree nasal endoscope was then used to examine the nasal cavity more completely.  No lesion was detectable.  A left intercartilaginous incision was made with a #15 blade since this was the area of previous biopsy by Dr. A.  The submucosal tissue was thickened diffusely, but there was no identifiable distinct or circumscribed lesion present.  Random biopsies of the submucosal tissue were taken and submitted to pathology for frozen section.  A diagnosis of diffuse invasive squamous cell carcinoma was rendered.  An alar incision was made with a #15 blade and the full-thickness incision was completed with the electrocautery.  The incision was carried more cephalad through the lower lateral cartilage up to the area of the upper lateral cartilage at the superior margin.  The full unit of the left nasal tip was excised completely and submitted to pathology after tagging and labeling it.  Frozen section examination again revealed diffuse squamous cell carcinoma throughout the soft tissues involving all margins.  Additional soft tissue was then taken from all margins tagging them for the pathologist.  The inferior margins were noted to be clear on the next frozen section report, but there was still disease present in the region of the upper lateral cartilage at its insertion with the nasal bone.  A Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum off the maxillary process and off the inferior aspect of the nasal bone.  Additional soft tissue was taken in these regions along the superior margin.  The frozen section examination revealed persistent disease medially and additional soft tissue was taken and submitted to pathology.  Once all margins had been cleared histologically, additional soft tissue was taken from the entire wound.  A 5-mm chisel was used to take down the inferior aspect of the nasal bone and the medial-most aspect of the maxilla.  This was all submitted to pathology for routine permanent examination.  Xeroform gauze was then fashioned to cover the defect and was sutured along the periphery of the wound with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture to provide a barrier and moisture.  The anesthetic was then discontinued as the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.","surgery, nasal cavity, joseph elevator, squamous cell carcinoma, endoscopy, intranasally, maxilla, nasal ala, nasal tip, rhinectomy, septorhinoplasty, nasal endoscopy, lateral cartilage, frozen section, additional soft, squamous cell, cell carcinoma, nasal, cartilage, squamous, carcinoma, cavity, tissue "

The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.

This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.,PLAN: , Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.,CONSENT:,  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.,FINDINGS: , The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.,General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.,It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.,Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.,Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.,The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,DISPOSITION:,  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.,NOTE: , The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.

Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  ,Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.","surgery, sheath, vertebral body, regional pain syndrome, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, stellate ganglion, rftc, radiofrequency, radiograph, cricothyroid, thermocoagulation, ganglion,"

Nasal obstruction secondary to deviated nasal septum.,2.  Bilateral turbinate hypertrophy.,PROCEDURE:,  Cosmetic rhinoplasty.  Request for cosmetic change in the external appearance of the nose.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 26-year-old white female with longstanding nasal obstruction.  She also has concerns with regard to the external appearance of her nose and is requesting changes in the external appearance of her nose.  From her functional standpoint, she has severe left-sided nasal septal deviation with compensatory inferior turbinate hypertrophy.  From the aesthetic standpoint, the nose is over projected, lacks rotation, and has a large dorsal hump.  First we are going to straighten the nasal septum and reduce the size of the turbinates and then we will also take down the hump, rotate the tip of the nose, and de-project the nasal tip.  I explained to her the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications for postsurgical procedure.  She had her questions asked and answered and requested that we proceed with surgery as outlined above.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The face, head, and neck were sterilely prepped and draped.  The nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with a left hemitransfixion incision, which was brought down into the left intercartilaginous incision.  Right intercartilaginous incision was also made and the dorsum of the nose was elevated in the submucoperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.  Intact bilateral septomucoperichondrial flaps were elevated and a severe left-sided nasal septal deviation was corrected by detachment of the caudal nasal septum from the maxillary crest in a swinging door fashion and placing it back into the midline.  Posterior vomerine spur was divided superiorly and inferiorly and a large spur was removed.  Anterior and inferior one-third of each inferior turbinate was clamped, cut, and resected.  The upper lateral cartilages were divided from their attachments to the dorsal nasal septum and the cartilaginous septum was lowered by approximately 2 mm.  The bony hump of the nose was lowered with a straight osteotome by 4 mm.  Fading medial osteotomies were carried out and lateral osteotomies were then created in order to narrow the bony width of the nose.  The tip of the nose was then addressed via a retrograde dissection and removal of cephalic caudal semicircle cartilage medially at the tip.  The caudal septum was shortened by 2 mm in an angle in order to enhance rotation.  Medial crural footplates were reattached to the caudal nasal septum with a projection rotation control suture of #3-0 chromic.  The upper lateral cartilages were rejoined to the dorsal septum with a #4-0 plain gut suture.  No middle valves or bone grafts were necessary.  Intact mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture and Doyle nasal splints were placed on either side of the nasal septum.  The middle meatus was filled with Surgicel and Cortisporin otic and external Denver splint was applied with sterile tape and Mastisol.  Excellent aesthetic and functional results were thus obtained and the patient was awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room in good condition.","surgery, nasal obstruction, cosmetic, dorsal hump, endotracheal tube, hemitransfixion incision, hypertrophy, intercartilaginous, intercartilaginous incision, nasal septum, nasal tip, septomucoperichondrial, submucoperichondrial, subperiosteal, turbinate, vomerine, spur, nasal septal, nasal, rhinoplasty, septum, "

She had an episioproctotomy associated with the birth of her seven pound son in 1998 and immediately noted the spontaneous loss of gas and stool. She had her fistula repaired by Dr. R in 2000 and did well for approximately one year, without complaint, when she again noted the spontaneous loss of stool and gas from her vagina. She has partial control if her stools are formed, but she has no control of her gas. She is a type 2 diabetic, with poorly controlled blood sugars at times, however, her diabetes has been fairly well controlled of late.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY:, She had a 1 cm fistulous tract, approximately 4 cm proximal to the vaginal introitus. This communicated directly with the low rectal vault. She had good rectal sphincter tone and a very thin perineal body. The fistulous tract was excised completely and intact. The underlying rectal mucosa was closed with chromic and the perineal body was reinforced and reconstructed. At the completion of the procedure, the repair is watertight, there were no other defects.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent general endotracheal anesthesia. She was then placed in the lithotomy position using candy-cane stirrups. The vulva and vagina were prepped and the patient was draped. A lacrimal duct probe was used to define the fistulous tract and a transperineal incision was made. The rectovaginal septum was developed and with an index finger in the rectum, the rectovaginal septum was easily defined. The fistulous tract was isolated and using the lacrimal duct probe, it was completely isolated. Using electrocautery dissection on the pure cut mode, the rectal mucosa was entered in a circumferential fashion as was the vaginal mucosa. This allowed for removal of the fistulous tract intact, with both epithelial layers preserved. The perineum and rectum were irrigated vigorously and then the rectal mucosa was reapproximated with a running stitch of number 4-0 chromic. The rectal vault was distended with saline and the repair was watertight. The defect was irrigated, suctioned, inspected and found to be free of clot, blood or debris. The perineal body was reconstructed with reapproximation of the levator muscles, using a series of interrupted horizontal mattress stitches of number 2-0 Vicryl. This allowed for excellent restoration of the perineal body. After this was accomplished, the defect was once again irrigated, suctioned, inspected, and found to be free of clot, blood or debris. The vaginal defect was closed with a running locking stitch of number 2-0 Vicryl and the perineal incision was closed with a subcuticular stitch of number 2-0 Vicryl. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition, after having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, transperineal approach, fistula tract, fistula, rectovaginal, septum, lacrimal duct, probe, candy-cane, perineal, closure of rectovaginal fistula, rectal mucosa, perineal body, fistulous tract, rectovaginal fistula, transperineal, fistulous, rectal,"

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Care was taken to ensure that the arm was placed in a relaxed manner away from the body to facilitate exposure and to avoid nerve injury.,An elliptical incision was made to incorporate the nipple-areolar complex and the previous biopsy site.  The skin incision was carried down to the subcutaneous fat but no further.  Using traction and counter-traction, the upper flap was dissected from the chest wall medially to the sternal border, superiorly to the clavicle, laterally to the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi muscle, and superolaterally to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle.  The lower flap was dissected in a similar manner down to the insertion of the pectoralis fascia overlying the fifth rib medially and laterally out to the latissimus dorsi.  Bovie electrocautery was used for the majority of the dissection and hemostasis tying only the large vessels with 2-0 Vicryl.  The breast was dissected from the pectoralis muscle beginning medially and progressing laterally removing the pectoralis fascia entirely.  Once the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle was identified, the pectoralis muscle was retracted medially and the interpectoral fat was removed with the specimen.,The axillary dissection was then begun by incising the fascia overlying axilla proper allowing visualization of the axillary vein.  The highest point of axillary dissection was then marked with a long stitch for identification by the surgical pathologist.  The axilla was then cleared of its contents by sharp dissection.  Small vessels entering the axillary vein were clipped and divided.  The axilla was cleared down to the chest wall, and dissection was continued laterally to the subscapular vein.  The long thoracic nerve was cleared identified lying against the chest and was carefully preserved.  The long thoracic nerve represented the posterior most aspect of the dissection.  As the axillary contents were dissected in the posterolateral axilla, the thoracodorsal nerve was identified and carefully preserved.  The dissection continued caudally until the entire specimen was freed and delivered from the operative field.  Copious water lavage was used to remove any debris, and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery.,Two Jackson-Pratt drains were inserted through separate stab incisions below the initial incision and cut to fit.  The most posterior of the 2 was directed into the axilla and the other directed anteriorly across the pectoralis major.  These were secured to the skin using 2-0 silk, which was Roman-sandaled around the drain.,The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was applied.  The drains were placed on ""grenade"" suction.

The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","surgery, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,"

Of note, past history is significant for pelvic radiation for cervical cancer many years previously.,FINDINGS: , The examination under anesthesia revealed a 1.5 cm nodule of disease extending slightly above the hymeneal ring.  There was no palpable lymphadenopathy in either inguinal node region.  There were no other nodules, ulcerations, or other lesions.  At the completion of the procedure there was no clinical evidence of residual disease.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  She was placed in the low anterior lithotomy position after adequate anesthesia had been induced.  Examination under anesthesia was performed with findings as noted, after which she was prepped and draped.  The femoral triangles were marked and a 10 cm skin incision was made parallel to the inguinal ligament approximately 3 cm below the ligament.  Camper's fascia was divided and skin flaps were elevated with sharp dissection and ligation of vessels where necessary.  The lymph node bundles were mobilized by incising the loose areolar tissue attachments to the fascia of the rectus abdominis.  The fascia around the sartorius muscle was divided and the specimen was reflected from lateral to medial.  The cribriform fascia was isolated and dissected with preservation of the femoral nerve.  The femoral sheath containing artery and vein was opened and vessels were stripped of their lymphatic attachments.  The medial lymph node bundle was isolated, and Cloquet's node was clamped, divided, and ligated bilaterally.  The saphenous vessels were identified and preserved bilaterally.  The inferior margin of the specimen was ligated, divided, and removed.  Inguinal node sites were irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Jackson-Pratt drains were placed and Camper's fascia was approximated with simple interrupted stitches.  The skin was closed with running subcuticular stitches using 4-0 Monocryl suture.,Attention was turned to the radical vulvectomy specimen.  A marking pen was used to outline the margins of resection allowing 15-20 mm of margin on the inferior, lateral, and anterior margins.  The medial margin extended into the vagina and was approximately 5-8 mm.  The skin was incised and underlying adipose tissue was divided with electrocautery.  Vascular bundles were isolated, divided, and ligated.  After removal of the specimen, additional margin was obtained from the right vaginal side wall adjacent to the tumor site.  Margins were submitted on the right posterior, middle, and anterior vaginal side walls.  After removal of the vaginal margins, the perineum was irrigated with four liters of normal saline and deep tissues were approximated with simple interrupted stitches of 2-0 Vicryl suture.

398," Pulmonary valve stenosis, supple pulmonic narrowing, and static encephalopathy", Surgery, Pulmonary Valve Stenosis ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 19-year-old boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia, underwent initial repair 12/04/1987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm Gore-Tex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare.  This was complicated by shunt thrombosis __________ utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  Resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.  On 04/07/1988, he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10-mm balloon.  He has been followed conservatively since that time.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmHg.  Right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30% oxygen throughout the case.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted.  The right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5-French marker pigtail catheter, which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  This catheter was then exchanged for a Judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left-sided heart was fully saturated.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45% systemic level.  There was a 25 mmHg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries.  Phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal.  Right-to-left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency.  The right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation.  There is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus.  The pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well.  The median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization.  Angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a non-dominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:,1.

She was advised regarding treatment options including radical hysterectomy versus radiation and the former was recommended. ,FINDINGS: , During the examination under anesthesia, the cervix was noted to be healing well from recent cone biopsy and no nodularity was noted in the supporting ligaments.  During the exploratory laparotomy, there was no evidence of disease extension into the broad ligament or bladder flap.  There was no evidence of intraperitoneal spread or lymphadenopathy.  ,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthetic was administered after which she was examined under anesthesia.  The vagina was then prepped and a Foley catheter was placed.  She was prepped and draped.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made three centimeters above the symphysis pubis.  The peritoneum was entered and the abdomen was explored with findings as noted.  The Bookwalter retractor was placed, and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneum was opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligaments.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised, and the bladder was mobilized using sharp dissection.  The pararectal and paravesical spaces were opened, and the broad ligament was palpated with no evidence of suspicious findings or disease extension.  The utero-ovarian ligaments were then isolated, divided and doubly ligated.  Tubes and ovaries were mobilized.  The ureters were dissected free from the medial leaf of the peritoneum.  When the crossover of the uterine artery was reached, and the artery was isolated at its origin, divided and ligated.  The uterine artery pedicle was dissected anteriorly over the ureter.  The ureter was tunneled through the broad ligament using right angle clamps for tunneling after which each pedicle was divided and ligated.  This was continued until the insertion point of the ureter into the bladder trigone.  The peritoneum across the cul-de-sac was divided, and the rectovaginal space was opened.  Clamps were placed on the uterosacral ligaments at their point of origin.  Tissues were divided and suture ligated.  Clamps were placed on the paravaginal tissues, which were then divided, and suture ligated.  The vagina was then clamped and divided at the junction between the middle and upper third.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were repositioned in the retroperitoneum for the lymphadenectomy.  The borders of dissection included the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, the crossover of the deep circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery inferiorly, the psoas muscle laterally and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The obturator nerves were carefully isolated and preserved bilaterally and served as the posterior border of dissection.  Ligaclips were applied where necessary.  After removal of the lymph node specimens, the pelvis was irrigated.  The ovaries were transposed above the pelvic brim using running stitches.  Packs and retractors were removed, and peritoneum was closed with a running stitch.  Subcutaneous tissues were irrigated, and fascia was closed with a running mass stitch using delayed absorbable suture.  Subcutaneous adipose was irrigated, and Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running stitch.  Skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch.

Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","surgery, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl sutures, pelvis, renal, ureteropelvic, sutures, "

My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.","surgery, bilateral lymph node dissection, retropubic prostatectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, gleason score, prostate cancer, trus, biopsy, bilateral lymph node, lymph node dissection, catheter was inserted, bilateral lymph, node dissection, vicryl stitch, prostatic pedicles, pelvic veins, external iliac, iliac vein, seminal vesicle, lymph node, foley catheter, dorsal venous, venous complex, bladder neck, dissection, prostatectomy, bladder, endopelvic, vicryl, catheter, vein, venous, fascia, dorsal, urethra, "

Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, prostate cancer, foley catheter, gleason, psa, prostate, adenocarcinoma, bladder neck, core biopsy, figure-of-eight, lymph node dissection, nerve-sparing, prostatectomy, rectus fascia, retropubic, bladder neck dissection, dorsal vein complex, nerve sparing, perirectal fat, seminal vesicles, sutures, bladder, urethra, posteriorly, seminal, vesicles, fascia, neck, dissection,"

He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  Skin was approximated by using metallic clips.

407," The patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.", Surgery, Pulmonary Atresia ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  He also has VACTERL association with hydrocephalus.  As an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  On 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional Glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, PDA ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  On 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  A repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated Glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  He then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  Blood pressures were found to be 13 mmHg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 Wood units.  On 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac Fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  A repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated Fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent Fontan fenestration and intolerance of Fontan fenestration occlusion.  The patient then followed conservatively since that time.  The patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a Fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract.,PROCEDURE:,  After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the Fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French VS catheter of a distal wire.  Apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  The wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the Fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  Attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  The catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  Left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  A balloon valvoplasty was performed using a Ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  Echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  Further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-French flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  There was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  The balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety.,Echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  A final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  Echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  Further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  Attention was then directed to a Fontan fenestration.  A balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in Fontan pressures from 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg.  With less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  The angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  A 7-French flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  A 10-mm Amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  Entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  There was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  Left pulmonary veins were not entered.  There was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the Fontan fenestration.  Mean Fontan pressures were 12 mmHg with a 1 mmHg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  Right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal.  Pulmonary flow was reduced to the QT-QS ratio of 0.7621.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 Wood units.,Angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  The left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  There was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional Glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the Glenn anastomosis and the Fontan anastomosis.  There was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  A large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the Fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  There is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  Levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  Angiogram with injection in the Fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  Majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries.,Following the device occlusion of Fontan fenestration, the Fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmHg with a 3 mmHg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  There was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  Mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  The calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QT-QS ratio of 0.921.  Angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the Fontan with no protrusion into the Fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a Fontan flow.  An ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.  A small degree of contrast returned to the heart.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Pulmonary atresia.,2.  VACTERL association.,3.  Persistent sinusoidal right ventricle to the coronary communications.,4.

The chest was prepped and draped in the routine fashion for insertion of a Port-A-Catheter.  The left subclavian vein was punctured with a single stick and a guidewire threaded through the needle into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was removed.  An incision was made over the guidewire for entrance of the dilator with sheath.  A second counter incision was made transversally on the chest wall about an inch and half below the puncture site with a #15 blade.  Hemostasis was effective to electrocautery, and a pocket was fashioned subcutaneously for positioning of the reservoir.  The Port-A-Catheter reservoir tubing was attached to the reservoir in the routine fashion.  The reservoir was placed in the pocket and sutured to the anterior chest wall muscle with three interrupted 4-0 Prolene sutures for stability.  Next, a catheter passer was passed from the pocket exiting through the skin at the puncture site, previously placed for the guidewire, and the Port-A-Catheter was pulled from the reservoir exiting on the skin.  It was placed on the chest, measured, and cut to the appropriate length.  This having been done, the dilator with sheath attached was passed over the guidewire into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  The guidewire and dilator were removed, and the Port-A-Catheter was threaded through the sheath into the superior vena cava, and the sheath removed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Fluoroscopy revealed the Port-A-Catheter to be in excellent position.  The Port-A-Catheter was accessed with a butterfly 90-degree needle percutaneously that drew blood well and flushed easily.  It was flushed with heparinized saline connected in cath.  This having been done, the puncture site was closed with a circumferential subcutaneous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a percutaneous circumferential subcuticular suture.  This having been done, attention was applied to the reservoir incision.  It was closed with two layers of continuous 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with a continuous 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch.  A dry sterile dressing was applied, and the patient having tolerated the procedure was transferred to the recovery room for postoperative care.","surgery, ovarian cancer, insertion, port-a-catheter, circumferential, counter incision, fluoroscopic, fluoroscopic guidance, guidewire, subclavian, superior vena cava, port a catheter, port, catheter, subcutaneously, vein"

Additional aspect of the temporalis muscle and fascia were incised with cutting Bovie current with effort made to preserve the posterior limb of the external carotid artery.  The scalp and temporalis muscle were then retracted anteroinferiorly with 0 silk sutures, attached rubber bands and Allis clamps and similar retraction of the posterior aspect of temporalis was retracted with 0 silk suture, attached with rubber bands and Allis clamps.  The bone flap, which had not been fixed in place was removed.  An additional portion of the temporofrontal bone based at the zygoma was removed with a B1 dissecting tool, B1 attached to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  Further bone removal was accomplished with Leksell rongeur, and hemostasis controlled with the use of bone wax.,At this point, a retractor was placed along the frontal lobe for visualization of the perichiasmatic cistern with visualization made of the optic nerve and carotid artery.  It should be noted that cottonoid paddies were placed over the brain to protect the cortical surface of the brain both underneath the retractor and the remainder of the exposed cortex.  The sylvian fissure was then dissected with the dissection description being dictated by Dr. X.,Following successful splitting of the sylvian fissure to its apparent midplate, attention was next turned to the temporal tip where the approximate location of the cerebral aneurysm noted on CT angio, as well as conventional arteriography was noted and a peel incision was made extending from the temporal tip approximately 3 cm posterior.  This was enlarged with bipolar coagulation and aspiration and inferior dissection accomplished under the operating microscope until the dome of, what appeared to be, an aneurysm could be visualized.,Dissection around the dome with bipolar coagulation and aspiration revealed a number of abnormal vessels, which appeared to be involved with the aneurysm at its base and these were removed with bipolar coagulation.  Until circumferential dissection revealed 1 major arterial supply to the base of the aneurysm, this was felt to be able to be handled with bipolar coagulation, which was done and the vessel then cut with microscissors and the aneurysm removed in toto.,Attention was next turned to the apparent nidus of the arteriovenous malformation, which was somewhat medial and inferior to the aneurysm and the nidus was then dissected with the use of bipolar coagulation and aspiration microscissors as further described by Dr. X. With removal of the arteriovenous malformation, attention was then turned to the previous frontal cortical incision, which was the site of partial decompression of the patient's intracerebral hematoma on the day of her admission.  Self-retaining retractors were placed within this cortical incision, and the hematoma cavity entered with additional hematoma removed with general aspiration and irrigation.  Following removal of additional hematoma, the bed of the hematoma site was lined with Surgicel.  Irrigation revealed no further active bleeding, and it was felt that at this time both the arteriovenous malformation, associated aneurysm, and intracerebral hematoma had been sequentially dealt with.,The cortical surface was then covered with Surgicel and the dura placed over the surface of the brain after coagulation of the dural edges, the freeze dried fascia, which had been used at the time of the 1st surgery was replaced over the surface of the brain with additional areas of cortical exposure covered with a DuraGuard.  The 2nd bone flap from the inferior frontotemporal region centered along the zygoma was reattached to the initial bone flap at 3 sites using a small 2-holed plate and 3-mm screws and the portable minidriver.,With this, return of the inferior plate accomplished, it was possible to reposition the bone flaps into their initial configuration, and attachments were secured anterior and posterior with somewhat longer 2-holed plates and 3-mm screws to the frontal and posterior temporal parietal region.  The wound was then closed.  It should be noted that a pledget of Gelfoam had been placed over the entire dural complex prior to returning the bone flap.  The wound was then closed by approximating the temporalis muscle with 2-0 Vicryl suture, the fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, and the galea was closed with 2-0 interrupted suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","surgery, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, pterional craniotomy, bone flap, bipolar coagulation, arteriovenous, pterional, malformation, hematoma, intracerebral, "

No other obvious bleeding was seen.,TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.  At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, diarrhea, anterior base lesion, polypoid lesion, transanal excision, transanal, anesthesia, bleeding,"

The laryngeal monitoring was noted to be working fine.  Then, an incision was made in this area in a curvilinear fashion through the old scar, taken through the fat and the platysma level.  The strap muscles were found and there was scar tissue along the trachea and the strap muscles were elevated off of the left thyroid, the thyroid gland was then found.  Then, using bipolar cautery and a Coblation dissector, the thyroid gland inferiorly was dissected off and the parathyroid gland was left inferiorly and there was scar tissue that was released and laterally, the thyroid gland was released, then came into the Berry ligaments.  The Berry ligament was dissected off and the gland came off all the way to the superior and inferior thyroid vessels, which were crossed with the Harmonic scalpel and removed.  No bleeding was seen.  There was a small nick in the external jugular vein that was tied with a 4-0 Vicryl suture ligature.  After this was completed, on examining the specimen, there appeared to be a lobule on it and it was sent off as possibly parathyroid, therefore it was reimplanted in the left lower sternocleidomastoid region using the silk suture ligature.  After this was completed, no bleeding was seen.  The laryngeal nerve could be seen and intact and then Rubber band  drain was placed throughout the neck along the thyroid bed and 4-0 Vicryl was used to close the strap muscles in an interrupted fashion along with the platysma region and subcutaneous region and a running 5-0 nylon was used to close the skin and Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed along the skin edges and then on awakening, both laryngeal nerves were working normally.

She was referred to me by Dr. X.  The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate.  Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family.","surgery, cervical spondylosis, anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression, fusion, pmt, crown, vest, pmt halo, cervical,"

The patient was seen in the emergency room.  The patient had a complete fracture of both bones with shortening bayonet apposition.  Treatment options were offered to the family including casting versus closed reduction and pinning.  The parents opted for the latter.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery included risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, and need for later hardware removal, cast tightness.  All questions were answered, and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A small incision was made at the tip of the olecranon.  Initially, a 1.11 guidewire was placed, but this was noted to be too wide for this canal.  This was changed for a 0.79 K-wire.  This was driven up to the fracture site.  The fracture was manually reduced and then the K-wire passed through the distal segment.  This demonstrated adequate fixation and reduction of both bones.  The pin was then cut short.  The fracture site and pin site was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine.  The incision was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were cleaned and dried.  Dressed with Xeroform, 4 x 4.  The patient was then placed in a well-moulded long-arm cast.  He tolerated the procedure well.

The patient states she has extreme pain with plantar fascitis in her left foot and has attempted conservative treatment including orthotics without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment.  The patient has been NPO since mid night.  Consent is signed and in the chart.  No known drug allergies.,Details Of Procedure:  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety belt across the stomach.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the surgical site both medially and laterally across the plantar fascia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was applied for exsanguination and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then reflected on the operating, stockinet reflected, and the foot cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the plantar medial aspect of the left heel.  An approximately 0.75 cm incision was then created in the plantar fat pad over the area of maximal tenderness.,The incision was then deepened with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection until the plantar fascia was palpated.  A #15 blade was then used to transect the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral fibroids.  The foot was dorsiflexed against resistance as the fibers were released and there was noted to be increased laxity after release of the fibers on the plantar aspect of the foot indicating that plantar fascia has in fact been transacted.  The air was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin incision was then closed with #3-0 nylon in simple interrupted fashion.  Dressings consisted of #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted throughout all digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  Intraoperatively, an additional 80 cc of 1% lidocaine was injected for additional anesthesia in the case.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing on the left lower extremity with crutches.

He did not return for followup or radiotherapy as instructed, and the tumor has regrown.  For this reason, he is admitted for transsphenoidal reoperation with an attempt to remove as much tumor as possible.  The high-risk nature of the procedure and the fact that postoperative radiation is mandatory was made clear to him.  Many risks including CSF leak and blindness were discussed in detail.  After clear understanding of all the same, he elected to proceed ahead with surgery.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table, and after adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The back was prepped and draped in usual sterile manner.,A 14-gauge Tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space.  Clear and colorless CSF issued forth.  A catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm, and the needle was removed.  The catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion.,This no-touch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas.  Via injections through the lumbar drain, one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor.  This improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus.,The patient was then placed supine, and the 3-point headrest was affixed.  He was placed in the semi-sitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder.  Care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately.  The fluoroscope C-arm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection.  The metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope.  The oropharynx, nasopharynx, and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the abdominal region, and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was carefully closed in layers.,I then advanced a 0-degree endoscope up the left nostril.  The middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.  Needle Bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium.  The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid.  I entered into the sphenoid.,There was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present, and I slowly and carefully worked through all this.  I identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone, which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left, which was very well exposed, and the cavernous sinus on the right, which I exposed the very medial portion of.  The opening was wide until I had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present.,The operating microscope was then utilized.  Working under magnification, I used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril.,The dura was then carefully opened in the midline, and I immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma.  A frozen section was obtained, which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features.,Slowly and meticulously, I worked to remove the tumor.  I used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free.  The tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic.,Slowly and carefully, I systematically entered the sellar contents until I could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right.  There appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left.  It was consistent with what we saw on the MRI imaging.,The portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter.  A large amount of this was removed.  There was a CSF leak, as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free.,Under high magnification, I actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor.  While there may be a small amount of tumor remaining, it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus.  In fact, I reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well.,I reasoned that I had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression.  Attention was therefore turned to closure.,The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution, and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  I asked Anesthesiology to perform a Valsalva maneuver, and there was no evidence of bleeding.,Attention was turned to closure and reconstruction.  I placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air.  Using a polypropylene insert, I reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm.,DuraSeal was placed over this, and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and DuraSeal.,I inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation.  The middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position.  There was no significant intranasal bleeding, and for this reason, an open nasal packing was required.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct, and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of tumor.",

She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention.  Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation.  The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome.  Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband.  All questions were answered, and consent was obtained.  The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery.,FINDINGS:,1.  There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture.  Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length.,2.  The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement.  As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed.,3.  Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area.  The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient.  She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team.  She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics.  When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site.  A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able.  When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture.  Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive.  X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture.  At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends.  The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition.  Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case.,PLAN:  ,The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication.  She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture.","surgery, phalanx fracture, schantz pins, toe fracture, tibia fracture, pilon fracture, external fixation, proximal phalanx, fracture, toe, pilon, phalanx, reduction, tibia, proximal, fixation, "

She underwent in situ pinning.  The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw.  This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views.  Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock.  The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The upper aspect of the incision was reincised.  The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found.  A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw.  The previous screw measured 65 mm.  A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy.  The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion.  The guidewire was removed.  The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape.

His right arm was prepped and draped in sterile fashion from the antecubital fossa up.  Under ultrasound guidance, a #21-gauge needle was placed into his right cephalic vein.  A guidewire was then threaded through the vein and advanced without difficulty.  An introducer was then placed over the guidewire.  We attempted to manipulate the guidewire to the superior vena cava; however, we could not pass the point of the subclavian vein and we tried several maneuvers and then opted to do a venogram.  What we did was we injected approximately 4 mL of Visipaque 320 contrast material through the introducer and did a mapping venogram and it turned out that the cephalic vein was joining into the subclavian vein.  It was very tortuous area.  We made several more attempts using the mapping system to pass the glide over that area, but we were unable to do that.  Decision was made at that point then to just do a midline catheter.  The catheter was cut to 20 cm, then we inserted back to the introducer.  The introducer was removed.  The catheter was secured by two #3-0 silk sutures.  Appropriate imaging was then taken.  Sterile dressing was applied.

Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

The patient has a history of diabetes and has had a chronic ulceration to the right hallux and has been on outpatient antibiotics, which he failed.  The patient after a multiple conservative treatments such as wound care antibiotics, the patient was given the option of amputation as a treatment for the chronic resistant osteomyelitis.  The patient desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X.  The consent was available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position, a safety strap was placed across his waist.  Adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia and a total of 3.5 cc of 1:1 mixture 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected into the right hallux as a digital block.  The foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion lowering the operative field.,Attention was directed to the hallux where there was a full-thickness ulceration to the distal tip of the hallux measuring 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm.  There was a ________ tract, which probed through the distal phalanx and along the sides of the proximal phalanx laterally.  The toe was 2.5 times to the normal size.  There were superficial ulcerations in the medial arch of both feet secondary to history of a burn, which were not infected.  The patient had dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses that were found to be +2/4 bilaterally preoperatively.  X-ray revealed complete distraction of the distal phalanx and questionable distraction of the lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx.  A #10 blade was used to make an incision down the bone in a transverse fashion just proximal to the head of the proximal phalanx.  The incision was carried mediolaterally and plantarly encompassing the toe leaving a large amount of plantar skin intact.  Next, the distal phalanx was disarticulated at the interphalangeal joint and removed.  The distal toe was amputated and sent to laboratory for bone culture and sensitivity as well as tissue pathology.  Next, the head of the proximal phalanx was inspected and found to be soft on the distal lateral portion as suspected.  Therefore, a sagittal saw was used to resect approximately 0.75 cm of the distal aspect of head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was also sent off for culture and was labeled proximal margin.  Next, the flexor hallucis longus tendon was identified and retracted as far as possible distally and transected.  The flexor tendon distally was gray discolored and was not viable.  A hemostat was used to inspect the flexor sheath to ensure no infection tracking up the sheath proximally.  None was found.  No purulent drainage or abscess was found.  The proximal margin of the surgical site tissue was viable and healthy.  There was no malodor.  Anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and passed this as a specimen to microbiology.  Next, copious amounts of gentamicin and impregnated saline were instilled into the wound.,A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the deep subcutaneous layer to release skin tension.  The plantar flap was viable and was debulked with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flap was folded dorsally and reapproximated carefully with #3-0 nylon with a combination of simple interrupted and vertical mattress sutures.  Iris scissors were used to modify and remodel the plantar flap.  An excellent cosmetic result was achieved.  No tourniquet was used in this case.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and surgery without apparent complications.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Coban.  The patient was transported via cart to Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs able and vascular status intact to right foot.  He will be readmitted to Dr. Katzman where we will continue to monitor his blood pressure and regulate his medications.  Plan is to continue the antibiotics until further IV recommendations.,He will be nonweightbearing to the right foot and use crutches.  He will elevate his right foot and rest the foot, keep it clean and dry.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday or Tuesday of next week.","surgery, osteomyelitis, phalanx, phalanx amputation, proximal margin, plantar flap, distal phalanx, proximal phalanx, proximal, hallux, amputation, foot, plantarly, distal"

There has been a progressive and gradual decline in the visual acuity.  By examination, this was found to be related to cataracts.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives (including observation or spectacles) were discussed in detail.  The patient accepted these risks and elected to proceed with cataract surgery.  All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained.,Questions were answered in personal conference with the patient to ensure that the patient had a good grasp of the operative goals, risks, and alternatives involved as well as the postoperative instructions.  A preoperative surgical history and physical examination was done to ensure that the patient was in optimal general health for cataract surgery.  To minimize and decrease the chance of bacterial infection, the patient was started on a course of antibiotic drops for two days prior to surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was identified and the procedure was verified.  The pupil was dilated per protocol.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a comfortable supine position.  The operative table was placed in Trendelenburg head-up tilt to decrease orbital congestion and posterior vitreous pressure.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual ophthalmic sterile fashion.  The lids and periorbita were prepped with full-strength Betadine solution with care taken to concentrate on sterilizing the eyelid margins.  The conjunctival cul-de-sac was also prepped in dilute Betadine solution.  The fornices were also prepped.  The drape was done meticulously to ensure complete eyelash inclusion.,An eyelid speculum was placed to separate the eyelids.  A paracentesis site was made.  Intracameral preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  Amvisc Plus was then used to stabilize the anterior chamber.  A 3-mm diamond blade was then used to carefully construct a clear corneal incision in the temporal location.  A 25-gauge pre-bent cystotome was used to begin a capsulorrhexis.  The capsular flap was removed.  A 27-gauge blunt cannula was used for hydrodissection.  The lens was able to be freely rotated within the capsular bag.  Divide-and-conquer technique was used for phacoemulsification.  After four sculpted grooves were made, a bimanual approach with the phacoemulsification tip and Koch spatula was used to separate and crack each grooved segment.  Each of the four nuclear quadrants was phacoemulsified.  Aspiration was used to remove remaining cortex with the I/A handpiece.  Viscoelastic was used to re-inflate the capsular bag.  The intraocular lens was injected into the capsular bag.  The lens was then dialed into position.  The lens was well-centered and stable.  Viscoelastic was aspirated.  BSS was used to re-inflate the anterior chamber to an adequate estimated intraocular pressure along with stromal hydration.  A Weck-Cel sponge was used to check both incision sites for leaks and none were identified.  The incision sites remained well approximated and dry with a well-formed anterior chamber and well-centered intraocular lens.  The eyelid speculum was removed and the patient was cleaned free of Betadine.  Zymar and Pred Forte drops were applied.  A firm eye shield was taped over the operative eye.  The patient was then taken to the Postanesthesia Recovery Unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Discharge instructions regarding activity restrictions, eye drop use, eye shield/patch wearing, and driving restrictions were discussed.  All questions were answered.  The discharge instructions were also reviewed with the patient by the discharging nurse.

Cardiac monitor and oxygen at 5 liters per minute were connected by the nursing staff.  Local anesthesia was obtained using 2% lidocaine, 0/75% Marcaine, 0.5 cc Wydase with 6 cc of this solution used in a paribulbar injection, followed by ten minutes of digital massage.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for eye surgery.  With the Zeiss operating microscopy in position, a lid speculum was inserted and a 4-0 black silk bridal suture placed in the superior rectus muscle.  With Westcott scissors, a fornix-based conjunctival flap was made.  The surgical limbus was identified and hemostasis obtained with wet-field cautery.  With a 57-Beaver blade, a corneoscleral groove was made and shelved into clear cornea.  A stab incision was made at 2 o'clock with a 15-degree blade.  With a 3.0 mm keratome, the shelved groove was attended into the anterior chamber.  Viscoelastic was inserted into the anterior chamber and anterior capsulotomy was performed in a continuous-tear technique.  Hydrodissection was performed with Balanced Salt Solution.  Phacoemulsification was performed in a two-headed nuclear fracture technique.  The remaining cortical material was removed with irrigation and aspiration handpiece.  The posterior capsule remained intact and vacuumed with minimal suction.  The posterior chamber intraocular lens was obtained.  It was inspected, irrigated, inserted into the posterior chamber without difficulty.  Inspection revealed the intraocular lens to be in good position with intact capsule and well-approximated wound.  There was no aqueous leak even with digital pressure.  The conjunctiva was pulled back into position with wet-field cautery.  A subconjunctival injection with 20 mg Gatamycine and 0.5 cc Celestone was given.  Tobradex ointment was instilled into the eye, which was patched and shielded appropriately, after removing the lid speculum and bridle suture.

Peyronie's disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700.,ANESTHESIA:,  General LMA.,SPECIMEN: , Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis.,PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt.

She had had a previous PD catheter placed, but it became infected and had to be removed.  She, therefore, comes back to the operating room for a new PD catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A small transverse right upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The fascia was divided and the posterior fascia and peritoneum were identified.  A hole was made in the posterior fascia through the peritoneum and into the peritoneal cavity.  The omentum came up through the hole and so therefore the omentum was actually brought up and a small portion of it removed, which could easily be brought up through the incision.  A PD catheter was then placed into the pelvis over a guidewire.  At this point, the peritoneum and posterior fascia was closed around the catheter.  The anterior fascia was then closed over the top of the cuff leaving the cuff buried in the fascia.  The second incision was then made lateral and the catheter brought out through a second incision and the subcutaneous cuff then positioned at that site.  The catheter was then connected and two runs of a 150 mL of fluid were made with a good inflow and a good clear return.  The skin was closed with 5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied and the young lady awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, pd catheter, catheter, omentum, peritoneal dialysis catheter, peritoneal dialysis, renal failure, peritoneal, dialysis, renal"

All of their questions were answered.  Informed consent was signed.  The patient was brought into the operating room.  A surgical time-out was performed during which all members of the operating room staff agreed upon the patient's name, operation to be performed, and correct operative eye.  After administration of general anesthesia, the patient was intubated without incident.,The right eye was prepared and draped in the usual fashion for ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was used to separate the eyelids of the left eye.  A 9 o'clock anterior chamber paracentesis was created with Supersharp blade and the anterior chamber was filled with Healon.  The clear corneal incision was superior to the visual axis and was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures with the knots buried.  A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy __________ was initiated by performing partial conjunctival peritomies in the superonasal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal quadrants with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery.  A 7-0 Vicryl suture was preplaced in the mattress fashion, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus in the inferotemporal quadrant.  A microvitreoretinal blade was used to create a sclerotomy at this site and a 4-mm infusion cannula was introduced through the sclerotomy and tied in place with the aforementioned suture.  The presence of the tip of the cannula was confirmed to be within the vitreous cavity prior to initiation of posterior infusion.  Two additional sclerotomies were created superonasally and superotemporally, 3 mm posterior to the surgical limbus with microvitreoretinal blade.,The vitreous cutter was used to perform the pars plana lens actively preserving peripheral anterior capsule.  The pars plana vitrectomy was performed with the assistance of the BIOM non-contact lens indirect viewing system using the light pipe illuminator and the vitreous cutter.  The vitreous was trimmed to the vitreous base.  A posterior vitreous detachment was created and extended 360 degrees with the assistance of triamcinolone for staining.,The foreign body appeared to exit the posterior pole along the superotemporal arcade and apparently severed a branched retinal artery resulting in an area of macular ischemia with retinal whitening along its course.  The exit wound was explored.  No intraocular foreign body or mural foreign body was observed with the assistance of intraocular forceps.  The intraocular magnet was then inserted through the sclerotomy and no foreign body was again identified.,An air-fluid exchange was performed with the assistance of the soft-tip extrusion cannula and the retinal periphery was examined with scleral depression.  No retinal breaks or defects were noted in the periphery.  The plugs were placed in the sclerotomies and the conjunctival peritomy was extended at 360 degrees.  Each of the rectus muscles was isolated on a 2-0 silk suture and a #XXX band was threaded beneath each of the rectus muscle and fixed to itself in the inferonasal quadrant with the Watzke sleeve.  The buckle was sutured to the eye wall with 5-0 Mersilene sutures in each quadrant in a mattress fashion.  The buckle was trimmed and the height of the buckle was inspected internally and noted to be adequate.,Residual intraocular fluid was removed with a soft-tip extrusion cannula and the sclerotomies were closed with 7-0 Vicryl sutures.  A 12% concentration of C3F8 gas was flushed through the eye.  The infusion cannula was removed and the sclerotomy was closed with the preplaced 7-0 Vicryl suture.  All of the sclerotomies were noted to be airtight.

The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture.  Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted.  Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks.  Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned.,FINDINGS:,1.  Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered.  The clavicular head was noted to be intact.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion.,2.  Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps.,3.  A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site.  Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair.,OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: , The patient was identified in the preop holding area.  His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient.  He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team.  He then received prophylactic antibiotics.  A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment.  At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative markings were still visible at this point.  A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion.  Dissection was carried down.  The deltoid was retracted laterally.  The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion.  There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head.  Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion.  This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump.  At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site.  At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone.  For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded.  The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair.  At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation.  Aggressive external rotation was not performed.  The wound was then copiously irrigated.  The cephalic vein was not injured during the case.  The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips.  Sterile dressing was then placed.  Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block.  The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated.,Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days.  We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression.","surgery, tendon rupture, interscalene block, pectoralis major tendon rupture, pectoralis major tendon, repair, pectoralis, interscalene, tendon, rupture, sutures,"

466, Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus., Surgery, Patent Ductus Arteriosus ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 5-1/2-year-old, who recently presented with a cardiac murmur diagnosed due to a patent ductus arteriosus.  An echocardiogram from 09/13/2007 demonstrated a 3.8-mm patent ductus arteriosus with restrictive left-to-right shunt.  There is mild left atrial chamber enlargement with an LA/AO ratio of 1.821.  An electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with possible left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for device closure of a ductus arteriosus.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures up to the branch pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated a small, type A patent ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  Minimal diameter was approximately 1.6 mm with ampulla diameter of 5.8 mm and length of 6.2 mm.  The wedge catheter could be directed from the main pulmonary artery across the ductus arteriosus to the descending aorta.  This catheter exchanged over wire for a 5-French nit-occlude delivery catheter through which a nit-occlude 6/5 flex coil that was advanced and allowed to reconfigure the descending aorta.  Entire system was then brought into the ductal ampulla or one loop of coil was delivered in the main pulmonary artery.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed by fluoroscopy, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic measurements and angiogram in the descending aorta were then repeated approximately 10 minutes following device implantation.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was normal with a slight increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus.  The left-sided heart was fully saturated.  The phasic right-sided and left-sided pressures were normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal and pulmonary flow was slightly increased with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a small conical shaped ductus arteriosus with a small left-to-right angiographic shunt.  The branch pulmonary arteries appeared normal.  There is otherwise a normal left aortic arch.,Following coil embolization of the ductus arteriosus, there is no change in mixed venous saturation.  No evidence of residual left-to-right shunt.  There is no change in right-sided pressures.  There is a slight increase in the left-sided phasic pressures.  Calculated systemic flow was unchanged from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QP:QS ratio of 1:1.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta showed a majority of coil mass to be within the ductal ampulla with minimal protrusion in the descending aorta as well as the coil in the main pulmonary artery.  There is a trace residual shunt through the center of coil mass.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:, Patent ductus arteriosus.,SURGERIES (INTERVENTIONS):  ,Coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus.,MANAGEMENT:  ,The case to be discussed at Combined Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery case conference.

He did this while playing basketball.,He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam.  Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum.  Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon.  He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  A thigh high tourniquet was placed.  He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes.  Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself.,A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape.  The inferior pole was freshened up.  Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer.  This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly.  There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella.  Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk.

She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.,FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:,  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.,Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision.""  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.

At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment.  Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room.  We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.  The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.  Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.,The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size.  Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.  At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion.  Unfortunately, the catheter was open.  I did not have a drainage system at that time.  So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid.  The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment.

Closure of the pocket after formation of pocket for pacemaker.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient was brought to the cath lab, draped and prepped in the usual sterile fashion, received 1.5 mg of versed and 25 mg of Benadryl for conscious sedation.,Access to the right subclavian was successful after the second attempt.  The first attempt accessed the left subclavian artery.  The needle was removed and manual compression applied for five minutes followed by re-accessing the subclavian vein successfully.  The J-wire was introduced into the left subclavian vein.,The anterior wall chest was anesthetized with lidocaine 2%, 2-inch incision using a #10 blade was used.,The pocket was formed using blunt dissection as he was using the Bovie cautery for hemostasis.  The patient went asystole during the procedure.  The transcutaneous pacer was used.  The patient was oxygenating well.  The patient had several compression applied by the nurse.  However, her own rhythm resolved spontaneously and the percutaneous pacer was kept on standby.,After that, the J-wire was tunneled into the pocket and then used to put the #7-French sheath into the left subclavian vein.  The lead from the Boston Scientific Dextrose model 12345, serial number 12345 was inserted through the left subclavian to the right atrium; however, it was difficult to really enter the right ventricle; and while the lead was in place, the side port of the sheath was used to inject 15 mL of contrast to assess the subclavian and the right atrium.  The findings were showing different anatomy, may be consistent with persistent left superior vena cava, and the angle to the right ventricle was different.  At that point, the lead stylet was reshaped and was able to cross the tricuspid valve in a position consistent with the mid septal place.,At that point, the lead was actively fixated.  The stylet was removed.  The R-wave measured at 40 millivolts.  The impedance was 580 and the threshold was 1.3 volt.  The numbers were accepted and because of the patient's fragility and the different anatomy noticed in the right atrium, concern about putting a second lead with re-access of the subclavian was high.  I decided to proceed with a single-chamber pacemaker as a backup system.,After that, the lead sleeve was used to actively fixate the lead in the anterior chest with two Ethibond sutures in the usual fashion.,The lead was attached to the pacemaker in the header.  The pacemaker was single-chamber pacemaker Altura 60, serial number 123456.  After that, the pacemaker was put in the pocket.  Pocket was irrigated with normal saline and was closed into two layers, deep interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and surface as continuous #4-0 Vicryl continuous.,The pacemaker was programmed as VVI 60, and with history is 10 to 50 beats per minute.  The lead position will be evaluated with chest x-ray.,No significant bleeding noticed.,CONCLUSION:  ,Successful single-chamber pacemaker implantation with left subclavian approach and venogram to assess the subclavian access site and the right atrial or right ventricle with asystole that resolved spontaneously during the procedure.

Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old gentleman who was involved in a crush injury to his right wrist.  He was placed into a well-molded splint after reduction was performed in the emergency department.  Further x-rays showed further distal fragment dorsal angulation that progressively worsened and it was felt that surgical intervention was warranted.  All risks, benefits, expectations, and complications of the surgery were explained to the patient in detail, and he signed the informed consent for ORIF of the right wrist.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating suite, placed in supine position on the operative table.  The Department of anesthesia administered a general endotracheal anesthetic, which the patient tolerated well.  The right upper extremity had a well-padded tourniquet placed on the right arm, which was insufflated and maintained for 40 minutes at 250 mmHg pressure.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A 5-cm incision was made over the flexor carpi radialis of the right wrist.  The skin was incised down to the subcutaneous tissue, the deep tissue was retracted, blunt dissection was performed down to the pronator quadratus.  Sharp dissection was performed through the pronator quadratus after which a tissue elevator was used to elevate this tissue.  Next, a reduction was performed placing the distal fragment into appropriate alignment.  This was checked under fluoroscopy, and was noted to be adequately reduced and in appropriate position.  An Acumed Accu-lock plate was placed along the volar aspect of the distal radius.  This was checked under AP and lateral views with C-arm, noted to be in appropriate alignment.  A 3.5-mm cortical screw was placed through the proximal aspect of the plate, positioned it into position.  Two distal locking screws were placed along the plate itself.  The screws were checked under AP and lateral views noting the fracture fragment was well aligned and appropriately reduced with the 2 screws being placed into appropriate position with the appropriate length as well as not being intraarticular.  Four more screws were placed along the distal aspect of the plate and 2 more proximal along the plate.  All locking screws placed into position and had excellent purchase into the bone or had excellent fixation into the plate and maintained the alignment of the fracture.  AP and lateral views were taken of these screw placements again.  None of these screws were into the joint and all had appropriate length into the dorsal cortex.  Two more 3.5 fully threaded cortical screws were placed along the proximal aspect of the plate and had excellent bicortical purchase.  AP and lateral views were taken of the wrist once again showing that this was appropriate reduction of the fracture as well as appropriate placement of the screws.  Bicortical purchase was appreciated and no screws were placed into the joint.  The wound itself was copiously irrigated with saline and Kantrex after which the subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 nylon stitch; 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected into the wound site after which sterile dressing was placed as well as the volar splint.  The patient was awakened from general anesthetic, transferred to the hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition.

Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line.  The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion.  The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column.  The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws.  It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface.  Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall.  Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same.  This will be dictated in separate note.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left was 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.

The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options.,The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail.  The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE #1: , Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx.  Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head.  The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound.,Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition.  The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition.  An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration.  Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove.  The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp.,Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment.  The access guide was noted to be in good position.  A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed.  The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal.  The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head.  The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal.,Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment.  It was then fixated with 1 screw.  A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction.  The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position.  Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory.  Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site.  Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally.  All rough edges were rasped smooth.  Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux.  A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated., ,PROCEDURE #2:,  Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux.  The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint.  All vital structures were identified and retracted.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface.  The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux.  Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected.  The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.,Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site.  The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved.  The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips.,Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear it when walking or standing., ,The next office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions.  The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress.",

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.","surgery, atrophic mandibular fracture, dental implant, open reduction and internal fixation, orif, mandibular fracture, mandible, atrophic, mandibular, dental, implant,"

She sustained a right open ankle fracture, right femur fracture, right femoral neck fracture, right open knee, and right elbow abrasions.  Given the emergent nature of the right femoral neck fracture and her young age as well as the open fracture, it was decided to proceed with an urgent operative intervention.  The risks of surgery were discussed in detail and the consents were signed.  The operative site was marked.  The patient was taken to the operating room where she was given preoperative clindamycin.  The patient had then general anesthetic performed by anesthesia.,A well-padded side tourniquet was placed.  Attention was turned to the right ankle first.  The large medical laceration was extended and the tissues were debrided.  All dirty of the all injured bone, muscle, and tissues were debrided.  Wound was then copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.  At this point, the medial malleolus fracture was identified and was reduced.  This was then fixed in with two 4.5 mm cannulated Synthes screws.,Next, the attention was turned to lateral malleolus.  Incision was made over the distal fibula.  It was carried down sharply through the skin in the subcutaneous issues.  Care was taken to preserve the superficial peroneal nerve.  The fracture was identified, and there was noted to be very comminuted distal fibula fracture.  The fracture was reduced and confirmed with fluoroscopy.  A 7 hole Synthes 3.5 mm locking plate was placed.  This was placed in a bridging fashion with three screws above and three screws below the fracture.  Appropriate reduction was confirmed under fluoroscopy.  A cotton test was performed, and the ankle did not open up.  Therefore, it was decided not to proceed with syndesmotic screw.,Next, the patient was then placed in the fracture table and all extremities were well padded.  All prominences were padded.  The right leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 2-cm incision was made just distal to the greater trochanter.  This was carried down sharply through the skin to the fascia.  The femur was identified.  The guidewire for a striker Asnis 6.5 mm screw was placed in the appropriate position.  The triangle guide was then used to ensure appropriate triangular formation of the remainder of the screws.  A reduction of the fracture was performed prior to placing all the guide wires.  A single 8 mm Asnis screw was placed inferiorly followed by two 6.5 mm screws superiorly.,Next, the abrasions on the right elbow were copiously irrigated.  The necrotic and dead tissue was removed.  The abrasions did not appear to enter the joints.  They were wrapped with Xeroform 4 x 4 x 4 Kerlix and Ace wrap.,Next, the lacerations of the anterior knee were connected and were extended in the midline.  They were carried down sharply to the skin and the retinacular issues to the joint.  The intercondylar notch was identified.  A guide wire for the striker T2 retrograde nail was placed and localized with fluoroscopy.  The opening reamer was used following the bolted guide wire was then passed.  The femur was then sequentially reamed using the flexible reamers.  A T2 retrograde nail 10 x 340 was then passed.  Two 5 mm distal locking screws and two 5 mm proximal locking screws were then placed.,Prior to reaming and passing the retrograde nail, the knee was copiously irrigated with 8 liters of normal saline.

Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.  No significant bleeding was appreciated.  The patient was subsequently extubated uneventfully and taken back to the recovery room in satisfactory and stable condition.  No complications arose.","surgery, fracture dislocation, spinal instrumentatio, comminuted, fracture, morselized, allograft, vicryl suture, mayfield tongues, cervical fusion, internal fixation, orif, cervical, fusion, fixation, spinal, reduction, instrumentation, "

Application of short leg splint.,ANESTHESIA:,  TIVA/local.,HISTORY: , This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal.  The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot.  She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain.  She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y.  The consent is available on the chart for review.  The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected.  Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base.  The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal.  An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized.  The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial.  There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view.  A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve.  A linear incision was created with a #10 blade.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached.  Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade.  Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone.  The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus.  A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy.  The fracture site was easily found.  An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis.,A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone.  Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone.  Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone.  Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced.  Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally.  A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly.  All this was done under fluoroscopy.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The fracture site was found to have rigid compression.  The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique.  A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance.  A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied.,A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied.  The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches.  She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg.  She is to follow up in the clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m..  She was given emergency contact numbers and will call or return if problems arise earlier.","surgery, metatarsal, internal screw fixation, leg splint, fractured right fifth metatarsal, pneumatic ankle tourniquet, ankle tourniquet, metatarsal base, fracture site, fractured, hypertrophic, bernstein, orif"

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition.","surgery, mandible, endotracheal, leibinger, pacu, oral maxillary facial surgery, maxillofacial, buckle, round bur, lidocaine with epinephrine, surgical steel wire, bilateral mandible fractures, mandible fracture, orif, symphysis, fracture, "

Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month.  Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee.  The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care.  Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta.  Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone.  Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal.  Risks of surgery include the risks of  anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab.  All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient was given Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch.  Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  The incision was then made.  The patient had significant  tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement.  We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus.  The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires.  Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage.  There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis.  This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer.  The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer.  The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment.  Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible.  The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end.  The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s.  Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes.  JP drain was placed on the medium gutter.  The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes.  The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOP PLAN:  ,The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain.  He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer.  Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother.  The patient will need subsequent hardware removal.  The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case.","surgery, intraarticular extension, tibial tubercle avulsion fracture, tubercle avulsion fracture, jp drain, cortical screw, hardware removal, tibial tubercle, tourniquet, orif, tubercle, tibial,"

There was no evidence of osteochondral defects of the talar dome.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle.,It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the above-named procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought back to operative room #4 of ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/03.  A spinal anesthetic was administered.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  He was then positioned on the beanbag.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, an anteromedial incision was made in order to perform a medial malleolus osteotomy to best localize the fracture region in order to be able to bone graft the comminuted fracture site.  At this time, a #15 blade was used to make approximately 10 cm incision over the medial malleolus.  This was curved anteromedial along the root of the saphenous vein.  The saphenous vein was located.  Its tributaries going plantar were cauterized and the vein was retracted anterolaterally.  At this time, we identified the medial malleolus.  There was evidence of approximately 80% avulsion, rupture of the deltoid ligament off of the medial malleolus.  This was a major blood feeder to the medial malleolus and we were concerned, once we were going to do the osteotomy, that this would later create healing problem.  It is for this reason that the pedicle, which was attached to the medial malleolus, was left intact.  This pedicle was the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, a MicroChoice saw was then used to make a box osteotomy of the medial malleolus.  Once this was performed, the medial malleolus was retracted anterolaterally with its remaining pedicle intact for later blood supply.  This provided us with excellent exposure to the fracture site of the medial side.  At this time, any loose comminuted pieces were removed.  The dome of the talus was also checked and did not reveal any osteochondral defects.  There was some comminution on the dorsal aspect of the complete talus fracture and we were concerned that once we place the screw, this would tend to extend the fracture site.  It is for this reason, we did the medial malleolar osteotomy to prevent this from happening in order to best expose the fracture site.  At this time, a reduction was performed.  The #7-0 partially threaded cannulated screws were used in order to fix the fracture.  At this time, a 3.2 mm guidewire was placed going from posterolateral to anteromedial.,This was placed slightly lateral to the Achilles tendon, percutaneously inserted, and then drilled in the according fashion across the fracture site.  Once this was performed, a skin knife was then used to incise over the percutaneous insertion in order to accommodate the screw going in.  A depth gauze was then used to measure screw length.  A cannulated drill was then used to drill across the fracture site to allow the entrance of the screw.  A 55 mm partially threaded #7-0 cannulated screw was then placed with excellent compression at the fracture site.  Once this was obtained, we checked the reduction again using intraoperative Xi-Scan in the AP and lateral direction.  This projection gave us excellent view of our screw placement and excellent compression across the fracture site.  At this time, we bone grafted the area of comminution using 1 cc of DynaGraft with crushed cancellous allograft.  This was placed using a freer elevator into the fracture site where the comminution was.  At this time, we copiously irrigated the wound.  The osteotomy site was then repaired, first clamped using two large tenaculum reduction clamps.  Two partially threaded #4-0 cannulated screws were then used to fix the osteotomy site and anatomical reduction was performed with excellent compression across the osteotomy site with the two screws.  Next, a #1-0 Vicryl was then used to repair the deltoid ligament, which was ruptured via the injury.  A tight repair was performed of the deltoid ligament.  At this time, again copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  A #2-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the subcutaneous skin and staples for the skin incision.  At this time, the leg was cleansed, Adaptic, 4 x 4, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  The patient was then placed in a plaster splint for mobilization.  The tourniquet was then released.  The patient was then transferred off the operating table to recovery in stable condition.  The prognosis for this fracture is guarded.  There is a high rate of avascular necrosis of the talar body, approximately anywhere from 40-60% risk.  The patient is aware of this and he will be followed as an outpatient for this problem.","surgery, deltoid ligament, medial malleolus osteotomy, open reduction internal fixation of the talus, hawkins iv talus fracture, medial malleolus, fracture site, malleolus, talus, medial, fracture, tourniquet, ligament, osteotomy, "

The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.  The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, orchiopexy, benzoin, crile hemostat, scarpa's layer, caudal block, cremasteric fascia, groin crease, hemiscrotum, iliopubic tract, inguinal canal, inguinal herniorrhaphy, intracuticular stitch, retroperitoneum, spermatic fascia, testicle, hernia sac, inguinal, incisionNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

Right carpal tunnel syndrome.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Open reduction and internal fixation of right distal radius fracture - intraarticular four piece fracture.,2.  Right carpal tunnel release.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,CLINICAL SUMMARY: , The patient is a 37-year-old right-hand dominant Hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago.  This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally.  In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop.  She is admitted for reconstructive operation.  The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury.,OPERATION:,  The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia.  Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity.  The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing.  The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification.  At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally.  This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly.  The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles.  The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin.  It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced.  This was an intraarticular four-part fracture.  Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced.  Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece.  The fracture was then manipulated.  The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it.  Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment.  A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires.  At this time, the distal screws were then placed.  The distal screws were the small screws.  These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed.  They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth.  Again, these were 18-20 mm screws.  After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires.  There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture.  After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit.  The screws were then placed.  These were 12 mm screws.  They were placed 4 in number.  The K-wires were then removed.  Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist.  This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure.  It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation.  The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed.  The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm.  In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon.  Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery.  The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion.  A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position.  The tourniquet was let down.  The fingers were immediately pink.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no operative complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, intraarticular fracture, esmarch, k-wires, open reduction and internal fixation, tourniquet, carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome, flexor carpi radialis, flexor pronator muscles, intraarticular, right distal radius, transverse carpal ligament, volar flexion crease, pronator quadratus, flexor carpi, carpi radialis, flexion crease, carpal ligament, carpal tunnel, carpal, volar"

Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal.  The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum.  Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses.  There is a hernia on the left side.  The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision.  An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia.  External ring was exposed with dissection as well.  The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal.  The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring.  Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring.  However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension.,Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided.  This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.,A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel.  The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good.  Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues.,Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion.  However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia.  The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side.  The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well.,The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure.  Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision.  The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition.  Instrument and sponge counts were correct.  There were no apparent complications.  Estimated blood loss was less than 20 to 30 mL.","surgery, bilateral orchiopexy, bilateral undescended testes, prentiss maneuver, subcutaneous tissues, internal ring, dartos pouch, scrotal incisions, undescended testes, spermatic cord, inguinal canal, testes, inguinally, orchiopexy, undescended, cord, vicryl, ultrasound, spermatic, canal,"
497," Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.", Surgery, ORIF - 2 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: , This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007.  While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture.  This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius.  The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions.  He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago.  The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8.  The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case.,Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware.  He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months.  Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds.,OPERATIVE NOTE: , After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously.  The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout.  The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient.  A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers.  A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator.  The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment.  The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment.  At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws.  The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair.  The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order.  The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order.  Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw.  Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment.  The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft.  All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial.  The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.  At this point, the tourniquet was let down.  The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline.  Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound.  Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length.  Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings.  The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex.  A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint.  Estimated blood loss was 10 mL.  There were no specimens.  Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours.","surgery, distal radius, c-arm, depo-medrol, frykman, jones-type dressing, kantrex, marcaine, open reduction and internal fixation, die-punch, intra-articular, lidocaine, pronator quadratus, radial styloid, ulnar styloid, distal radial ulnar joint, radial ulnar joint, distal, screws, orif, fracture, radial "

He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle.,IMPLANTS:, We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,IV FLUIDS:, 2000,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 40 mL,URINE OUTPUT:, 650,HISTORY: ,This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins.,Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch.,With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position.,With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis.,At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition.,PLAN:,1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months.,2. CPM for 0 to 90 degrees as tolerated.",

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments.  As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top.  We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps.  Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction.  We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal.  Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision.  IV Toradol was given.  Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.","surgery, ectopic position, inguinal hernia, inguinal hernia repair, hernia sac, tunica vaginalis, gubernacular attachments, testis ectopic position, curved mosquito clamp, caudal block, hernia repair, undescended testis, orchiopexy, dissected, hernia, inguinal, testis,"

Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.  The Scarpa fascia was closed with a 4-0 chromic suture, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on the both incisions, and IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.

The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions.","surgery, undescended testicle, orchiopexy & herniorrhaphy, external oblique fascia, inguinal ring, scrotal sac, oblique fascia, testicle, herniorrhaphy, orchiopexy, inguinal"

There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room.","surgery, diagnostic laparoscopy, caudal block, testis fixation, undescended testis, subcutaneous closure, testis, orchiectomy, laparoscopy, testicular, scrotum"

The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient was cleansed.,The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum.  He will follow up with Dr. X in 10 to 14 days.

The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative care despite multiple attempts at conservative care.  The preoperative discussion with the patient including alternative treatment options, the procedure itself was explained, and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, falling arch, digital contracture, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patients have improved function and less pain.  All questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point to interfere with normal daily activities.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following a light IV sedation, a posterior tibial nerve block and local infiltrate of the operative site was performed with 10 mL, and a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 0.25% Marcaine was affected.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balance anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Plantar fasciotomy, right foot.  The plantar medial tubercle of the calcaneus was palpated and a vertical oblique incision, 2 cm in length with the distal aspect overlying the calcaneal tubercle was affected. Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band.  A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel.  Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band.  The lateral plantar fascial band was left intact.  Visualization and finger probe confirmed adequate transection.  The surgical site was flushed with normal saline irrigation.,The deep layer was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted with combination of 1 horizontal mattress and simples.  The dressing consisted of Adaptic, 4 x 4, conforming bandages, and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact.

The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.","surgery, open cholecystectomy, hemorrhagic, gallbladder, serosal, liver bed, acute acalculous, acalculous cholecystitis, cystic duct, bovie cautery, rectus fascia, metzenbaum scissors, fascia, cholecystitis, cholecystectomy, cystic,"
510, Nissen fundoplication.   A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. , Surgery, Nissen Fundoplication ,"PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Nissen fundoplication.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.,A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.,The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.,The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.,Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.,The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.,The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The,52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.","surgery, umbilicus, insufflation, phrenoesophageal membrane, nissen fundoplication, gastric pouch, esophagus, penrose, antireflux, nissen, fundoplication, trocars, ligament,"

The initial portion of the procedure was harvesting a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin region.  This was accomplished by ellipsing out a 42-mm diameter circle of skin just below the thigh, peroneal crease.  The defect was then closed with 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 chromic suture in a running locked fashion.  The area was dressed with antibiotic ointment and then a Peri-Pad.  The patient's legs were brought out frog-leg back to the midline and sterile towels were placed over the opening in the drapes.  Surgical team's gloves were changed and then attention was turned to the planning of the left nipple flap.,A maltese cross pattern was employed with a 1-cm diameter nipple and a 42-mm diameter nipple areolar complex.  Once the maltese cross had been designed on the breast at the point where the nipple was to be placed, the areas of the portion of flap were de-epithelialized.  Then, when this had been completed, the dermis about the maltese cross was incised full thickness to allow mobilization of the flap to form the neonipple.  At this point, a Bovie electrocautery was used to control bleeding points and then 4-0 chromic suture was used to suture the arms of the flap together creating the nipple.  When this had been completed, the skin graft, which had been harvested from the left groin was brought onto the field where it was prepared by removing all subcutaneous tissue from the posterior aspect of the graft and carefully removing the hair follicles encountered within the graft.  At this point, the graft was sutured into position in the defect using 3-0 chromic in an interrupted fashion and then trimming the ellipse to an appropriate circle to fill the areola.  At this point, 4-0 chromic was used to run around the perimeter of the full-thickness skin graft and then at this point the nipple was delivered through a cruciate incision in the middle of the skin graft and then inset appropriately with 4-0 chromic.  The areolar skin graft was pie crusted.  Then, at this point, the area of areola was dressed with silicone gel sheeting.  A silo was placed over the neonipple with 3-0 nylon through the apex of the neonipple to support the nipple in an erect position.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were then applied.,At this point, attention was turned to the right breast where a 2-cm wide ellipse transversely oriented and with its inferior most aspect just inferior to the transverse mastopexy incision line was made.  The skin was removed from the area and then a layered closure of 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 PDS in a running subcuticular fashion was carried out.  When this had been completed, the Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied to the transverse right breast incision.  Fluff dressings were applied to the right breast as well as the area around the silo on the left breast around the reconstructed nipple areola.  The patient was then placed in Surgi-Bra and then was taken from the operating room to the recovery room in good condition.","surgery, nipple areola, breast asymmetry, general endotracheal, peri-pad, surgi-bra, breast cancer, frog-leg position, full-thickness skin graft, general endotracheal anesthesia, mastopexy, nipple areolar complex, nipple areolar reconstruction, nipple flap, prepped and draped, transverse mastopexy, areolar reconstruction, skin graft, graft, nipple, areolar, breast"

An orogastric was placed and a Foley catheter placed.  He was placed in a modified flank position with the hips rotated to 45 degrees.  Pillow was used to prevent any pressure points.  He was widely shaved, prepped, and draped.  A marking pen was used to delineate a site for the Pneumo sleeve in the right lower quadrant and for the trocar sites in the midline just above the umbilicus and halfway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus.  The incision was made through the premarked site through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was incised in the direction of its fibers.  Muscle-splitting incision was made in the internal oblique and transversus abdominis.  The peritoneum was opened and the Pneumo sleeve was placed in the usual fashion being sure that no bowel was trapped inside the ring.  Then, abdominal insufflation was carried out through the Pneumo sleeve and the scope was passed through the Pneumo sleeve to visualize placement of the trocars in the other two positions.  Once this had been completed, the scope was placed in the usual port and dissection begun by taking down the white line of Toldt, so that the colon could be retracted medially.  This exposed the duodenum, which was gently swept off the inferior vena cava and dissection easily disclosed the takeoff of the right renal vein off the cava.  Next, attention was directed inferiorly and the ureter was divided between clips and the inferior tongue of Gerota fascia was taken down, so that the psoas muscle was exposed.  The attachments lateral to the kidney was taken down, so that the kidney could be flipped anteriorly and medially, and this helped in exposing the renal artery.  The renal artery had been previously noticed on the CT scan to branch early and so each branch was separately ligated and divided using the stapler device.  After the arteries had been divided, the renal vein was divided again using a stapling device.  The remaining attachments superior to the kidney were divided with the Harmonic scalpel and also utilized the stapler, and the specimen was removed.  Reexamination of the renal fossa at low pressures showed a minimal degree of oozing from the adrenal gland, which was controlled with Surgicel.  Next, the port sites were closed with 0 Vicryl utilizing the passer and doing it over the hand to prevent injury to the bowel and the right lower quadrant incision for the hand port was closed in the usual fashion.  The estimated blood loss was negligible.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, renal mass, foley catheter, gerota fascia, muscle-splitting incision, pneumo sleeve, endotracheal, laparoscopic, nephrectomy, orogastric, renal fossa, right lower quadrant, trocar, umbilicus, vena cava, renal, pneumo, radical, "

The patient was recently thought to have obstruction to the transplant and a stent was placed in to the transplant percutaneously, but the ureter was wide open and there was no evidence of obstruction.  Because the kidney was felt to be irretrievably lost and immunosuppression had been withdrawn, it was elected to go ahead and remove the kidney and hopes that her fever and toxic course could be arrested.,With the patient in the supine position, the previously placed nephrostomy tube was removed.  The patient then after adequate prepping and draping, and placing of a small roll under the right hip, underwent an incision in the direction of the transplant incision down through and through all muscle layers and into the preperitoneal space.  The kidney was encountered and kidney was dissected free of its attachments through the retroperitoneal space.  During the course of dissection, the iliac artery and vein were identified as was the native ureter and the patient's ilioinguinal nerve; all these were preserved.  The individual vessels in the kidney were identified, ligated, and incised, and the kidney was removed.  The ureter was encountered during the course of resection, but was not ligated.  The patient's retroperitoneal space was irrigated with antibiotic solution and #19 Blake drain was placed into the retroperitoneal space, and the patient returned to the recovery room in good condition.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  900 mL.","surgery, renal transplant, blake drain, rejection, iliac artery, ilioinguinal, immunosuppression, kidney function, nephrectomy, nephrostomy tube, retroperitoneal space, toxic, ureter, vein, transplant, renal, retroperitoneal, kidney, "

The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well.  The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  All bony prominences were adequately padded.  Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time.  The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The hand was inspected.  Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture.  The sutures were removed and the wound was explored.  It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected.  The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact.  We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP.  We copiously irrigated the wound.  Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture.  The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact.  Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair.  Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury.  The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve.  The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture.  The hands were well approximated.  The nerve was not under undue tension.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture.  Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed.  The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.

516, Laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy due to right renal mass., Surgery, Nephrectomy - Partial (Laparoscopic ) ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  250 mL.,X-RAYS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Included right renal mass as well as biopsies from the base of the resection.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAINS: , Included a JP drain in the right flank as well as a #16-French Foley catheter per urethra.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 60-year-old gentleman with a history of an enhancing right renal mass approximately 2 cm in diameter.  I had a long discussion with him concerning variety of options.  We talked in particular about extirpated versus ablative surgery.  Based on his young age and excellent state of health, decision was made at this point to proceed to a right partial nephrectomy laparoscopically.  All questions were answered, and he wished to proceed with surgery as planned.  Note that the patient does have a positive family history of renal cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After acquisition of proper informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via endotracheal rod, he was placed into the right anterior flank position with his right side elevated on a roll and his right arm across his chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and he was securely taped to the table.  Note that sequential compression devices were in place on both lower extremities and were activated prior to induction of anesthesia.  His abdomen was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Note that a #16-French Foley catheter was in place per urethra as well as an orogastric tube.  The abdomen was insufflated at the right lateral abdomen using the Veress needle to a pressure of 15 without incident.  We then placed a Visiport 10 x 12 trocar in the right lateral abdomen.  With the trocar in place, we were able to place the remaining trocars under direct laparoscopic visualization.  We placed three additional trocars.  An 11 mm screw type trocar at the umbilicus, a 6 screw type trocar 7 cm in the midline above the umbilicus, and a 10 x 12 trocar to serve as a retractor port approximately 8 cm inferior in the midline.,The procedure was begun by reflecting the right colon by incising the white line of Toldt.  The colon was reflected medially, and the retroperitoneum was exposed on that side.  This was a fairly superficial lesion, so decision was made in advance to potentially not perform vascular clamping, however, I did feel it important to get high level control prior to proceeding to the partial.  With the colon reflected, the duodenum was identified, and it was reflected medially under Kocher maneuver.  The ureter and gonadal vein were identified on the right side and elevated.  The space between the ureter and the gonadal vein was then developed, and the gonadal vein was dropped elevating only the ureter, and carrying this plane dissection up towards the renal hilum.  Once we got up to the renal hilum, we were able to skeletonize the renal hilar vessels partially, and in particular, we did develop some of the upper pole dissection above the level of the hilum to provide for access for a Satinsky clamp or bulldogs.  The remainder of the kidney was then freed off its lateral and superior attachments primarily using the Harmonic scalpel and the LigaSure device.,With the kidney free and the hilum prepared, the Gerota fascia was taken down overlying the kidney exposing the renal parenchyma, and using this approach, we were able to identify the 2-cm, right renal mass located in the lower pole laterally.  A cap of fat was left overlying this mass.  Based on the position of the mass, we performed intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound, which showed the mass to be somewhat deeper than initially anticipated.  Based on this finding, I decided to go ahead and clamp the renal hilum during resection.  A Satinsky clamp was introduced through the lower most trocar site and used to clamp the renal hilum en bloc.  Note that the patient had been receiving renal protection protocol including fenoldopam and mannitol throughout the procedure, and he also received Lasix prior to clamping the renal hilum.  With the renal hilum clamped, we did resect the tumor using cold scissors.  There was somewhat more bleeding than would be expected based on the hilar clamping; however, we were able to successfully resect this lesion.  We also took a biopsy at the base of the resection and passed off the table as a specimen for frozen section.  With the tumor resected, the base of the resection was then cauterized using the Argon beam coagulator, and several bleeding vessels were oversewn using figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures with lap ties for tensioning.  We then placed a FloSeal into the wound and covered it with a Surgicel and held the pressure.  We then released the vascular clamp.  Total clamp time was 11 minutes.  There was minimal bleeding and occlusion of this maneuver, and after unclamping the kidney, the kidney pinked up appropriately and appeared well perfused after removal of the clamp.  We then replaced the kidney within its Gerota envelope and closed that with 3-0 Vicryl using lap ties for tensioning.  A JP drain was introduced through the right flank and placed adjacent to the kidney and sutured the skin with 2-0 nylon.  The specimen was placed into a 10-mm Endocatch bag and extracted from the lower most trocar site after extending it approximately 1 cm.  It was evaluated on the table and passed off the table for Pathology to evaluate.  They stated that the tumor was close to the margin, but there appeared to be 1-2 mm normal parenchyma around the tumor.  In addition, the frozen section biopsies from the base of the resection were negative for renal cell carcinoma.  Based on these findings, the lower most trocar site was closed using a running 0 Vicryl suture in the fascia.  We then re-insufflated the abdomen and carefully evaluated the entire intraoperative field for hemostasis.  Any bleeding points were controlled primarily using bipolar cautery or hemoclips.  The area was copiously irrigated with normal saline.  The colon was then replaced into its normal anatomic position.  The mesentry was evaluated.  There were no defects noted.  We closed the 10 x 12 lateral most trocar site using a Carter-Thompson closure device with 0-Vicryl.  All trocars were removed under direct visualization, and the abdomen was desufflated prior to removal of the last trocar.  The skin incisions were irrigated with normal saline and infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, and the skin was closed using a running 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Benzoin and Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient was returned in supine position and awoken from general anesthetic without incident.  He was then transferred to hospital gurney and taken to the postanesthesia care unit for postoperative monitoring.  At the end of the case, sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct.

This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen.","surgery, renal mass, carter-thomason, endocatch bag, foley catheter, gi stapler, laparoscopic, ligasure, toldt, laparoscopic scissors, nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, screw-type trocar, umbilicus, upper pole, urethra, carter thomason closure device, laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy, carter thomason closure, carter thomason, renal hilum, kidney, abdomen, endotracheal, radical, oncocytoma, renal, "

Due to the peripheral nature of the tumor located in the mid to lower pole laterally, he has elected to undergo a partial nephrectomy.  Potential complications include but are not limited to,,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Postoperative pain.,4.  Herniation from the incision.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was transferred into the operating room.  General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position.  A left flank incision was made over the area of the twelfth rib.  The subcutaneous space was opened by using the Bovie.  The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie.  The fascial layer covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was entered.  Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the peritoneal envelope could be identified.  The peritoneum was swept medially.  The Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure.  The kidney was readily identified and was mobilized from outside Gerota's fascia.  The ureter was dissected out easily and was separated with a vessel loop.  The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the superior attachment.  The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing the vein and the artery.  The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a right-angle clamp.  A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery.  The tumor could be easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney.  The Gerota's fascia overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.  Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about 0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor.  Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal artery.  The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal renal cortex.  This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel.  The tumor was removed easily.  The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the base of the resection.  The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0 Vicryl suture.  The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.  Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down.  The Gerota's fascia was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  The area of the kidney at the base was covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures.  The bulldog clamp was removed and perfect hemostasis was evident.  There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal system.  A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting the left flank inferior to the incision.  The drain was anchored by using silk sutures.  The flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect.  The lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures.  The skin was finally reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, renal mass, bovie, finochietto retractor, gerota's fascia, herniation, bulldog clamp, needle biopsy, nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy, renal cell carcinoma, retroperitoneum, vicryl suture, gerota's, kidney, partial, renal, sutures, vicryl,"

The patient was found to have a complex mass in the upper pole and the lower pole of the kidney.  MRI and CAT scan showed questionable renal mass, which could be malignant.  Initial plan was to let the patient stabilize for 2 weeks and perform the nephrectomy.  At this point, the patient was unable to go home.  The patient continually complained of pain.  The patient required about 3 to 4 units of blood transfusions prior.  The patient initially came in with hemoglobin less than 5.  The hemoglobin prior to surgery was 10.,Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, respiratory failure, morbidity and mortality of the procedure due to her low ejection fraction were discussed.  Cardiac clearance was obtained.  The patient was high risk, family and the patient knew about the risk.  The recommendation from the pulmonologist, cardiologist, and medical team was to get the kidney out at this point because the patient and the family stated that they would not do well at home without any intervention.  The patient and family understood all the risks and benefits in order to proceed with the surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient had A-line triple-lumen catheter.  The patient was placed in left side up, right side down oblique position.  All the pressure points were well padded.  The right fistula was carefully padded completely around it.  Axilla was protected.  The fistula was checked throughout the procedure to ensure that it was stable.  The arms, ankles, knees, and joints were all padded with foam.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape.  OG and a Foley catheter were in place.  A supraumbilical incision was made about 6 cm in size and incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue and through the fascia and peritoneum was entered sharply.  There were some adhesions where the omentum was into the umbilical hernia, which was completely stuck.  The omentum was released out of that just so we could obtain pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained after using GelPort.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the left anterior axillary line, and mid clavicular line.  The colon was reflected medially.  Kidney was dissected laterally behind and inferiorly.  There was large hematoma visualized with significant amount of old blood, which was irrigated out.  Dissection was carried superiorly and the spleen was reflected medially.  The spleen and colon were all intact at the end of the procedure.  They were stable all throughout.  Using endovascular GIA stapler, all the medial and lateral dissection was carried through the stapler to ensure that the patient had minimal bleeding due to low cardiac reserve.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The renal vein and the renal artery were stapled and there was excellent hemostasis.,The dissection was carried lateral to the adrenal and medial to the right kidney.  The adrenal was preserved.  The entire kidney was removed through the hand port.  Irrigation was performed.  There was excellent hemostasis at the end of the nephrectomy.  Fibrin glue and Surgicel were applied just in case the patient had delayed DIC.  The colon was placed back and 12-mm ports were closed under direct palpation using 0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in a running fashion and was tied in the middle.  Please note that prior to the fascial closure, the peritoneum was closed using 0 Vicryl in running fashion.  The subcuticular tissue was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient was brought to the recovery in a stable condition.","surgery, laparoscopic, nephrectomy, laparoscopic hand assisted nephrectomy, triple lumen catheter, lumen catheter, running fashion, renal mass, renal bleed, dissection, hemostasis, kidney, renal"

Left neck mass biopsy and selective surgical neck dissection, left.", Surgery, Neck Mass Biopsy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Malignant mass of the left neck.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.,PROCEDURES,1.  Left neck mass biopsy.,2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.,Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.,Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.,With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.,The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.","surgery, neck mass biopsy, surgical neck dissection, internal jugular vein, external jugular vein, squamous cell carcinoma, neck mass, malignant mass, neck dissection, mass, neck, wedge, vein,"

He also has persistent tonsillitis with hypertrophy and tonsillolith and halitosis.  He also has developed tremendous edema to his posterior palate and uvula, which is causing choking.  Correction of these mechanical abnormalities is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the right and left nasal septal mucosa and right and left inferior turbinates were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using approximately 10 mL.  Afrin-soaked pledgets were placed in the nasal cavity bilaterally.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hemitransfixion incision was performed on the left with a #15 blade and submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  Anterior to the septal deflection, the septal cartilage was incised and an opposite-sided submucoperichondrial and mucoperiosteal flap was raised with the Cottle elevator.  The deviated portion of the nasal septal cartilage and bone was removed with a Takahashi forceps, and a large inferior septal spur was removed with a V-chisel.  Once the septum was reduced in the midline, the hemitransfixion incision was closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion.  The right and left inferior turbinates were trimmed in a submucous fashion using straight and curved turbinate scissors under direct visualization with a 4 mm 0 degree Storz endoscope.  Hemostasis was acquired by using suction electrocautery.  The turbinates were then covered with bacitracin ointment after cauterizing them and bacitracin ointment soaked Doyle splints were placed in the right and left nares and secured anteriorly to the columella with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was draped in a clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted and the McIvor was gently suspended from the Mayo stand.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using a Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in a similar fashion, retracted medially, and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole to inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in a subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle, and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  The extremely edematous portion of soft palate was resected using a right angle clamp and right angle scissor and was closed with 3-0 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight interrupted fashion.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.","surgery, nasal septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, nasal septoplasty, submucous resection, resection of soft palate, tonsillectomy, bilateral inferior turbinate, bovie electrocautery, nasal septal, inferior turbinates, turbinates, nasal, tonsillitis, electrocautery, hypertrophy,"

The patient is status post resection of the dorsal nasal sidewall skin cancer with nasolabial flap reconstruction with subsequent deformity.  In particular, the patient has had effacement of his alar crease with deepening of his nasolabial fold and notable asymmetry.  The patient was seen in consultation and felt to be a surgical candidate for improvement.  Risks and benefits of the operation were described to the patient in detail including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, scarring, possible damage to surrounding structures including neurovascular structures, need for revision of surgery, continued asymmetry, and anesthetic complication.  The patient understood these risks and benefits and consented to the operation.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to OR and placed supine on the operating table.  Dose of antibiotics was given to the patient.  Compression devices were placed on the lower extremities to prevent the knee embolic events.  The patient was turned to 180 degrees.  The ETT tube was secured and the area was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A head wrap was then placed on the position and we then began our local.  Of note, the patient had previous incisions just lateral to his lateral canthus bilaterally and that were used for access.  Local consisting a 50:50 mix of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was then injected into the subperiosteal plane taking care to prevent injury to the infraorbital nerves.  This was done bilaterally.  We then marked the nasolabial fold and began with the elevation of the left midface.,We began with a lateral canthal-type incision extending out over his previous incision down to subcutaneous tissue.  We continued down to the lateral orbital rim until we identified periosteum.  We then pulled in a periosteal elevator and elevated the midface down over the zygoma elevating some lateral mesenteric attachments down over the buccal region until we felt we had reached pass the nasolabial folds medially.  Care was taken to preserve the infraorbital nerve and that was visualized after elevation.  We then released the periosteum distally and retracted up on the periosteum and noted improved contour of the nasolabial fold with increased bulk over the midface region over the zygoma.,We then used our Endotine Coapt device to engage the periosteum at the desired location and then elevated the midface and secured into position using the Coapt bioabsorbable screw.  After this was then carried out, we then clipped and cut as well as the end of the screw.  Satisfied with this, we then elevated the periosteum and secured it to reinforce our midface elevation to the lateral orbital rim and this was done using 3-0 Monocryl.  Several sutures were then used to anchor the orbicularis and deeper tissue to create additional symmetry.  Excess skin along the incision was then removed as well the skin from just lateral to the canthus.  Care was taken to leave the orbicularis muscle down.  We then continued closing our incision using absorbable plain gut 5-0 sutures for the subciliary-type incision and then continuing with interrupted 6-0 Prolenes lateral to the canthus.,We then turned our attention to performing the z-plasty portion of the case.  A z-plasty was designed along the previous scar where it was padding to the notable scar deformity and effacement of crease and the z-plasty was then designed to lengthen along the scar to improve the contour.  This was carried out using a 15 blade down to subcutaneous tissue.  The flaps were debulked slightly to reduce the amount of fullness and then transposed and sutured into place using chromic suture.  At this point, we then noted that he had improvement of the nasal fold but continued asymmetry with regards to improved bulk on the left side and less bulk on the right and it was felt that a symmetrization procedure was required to make more symmetry with the midface bilaterally and nasolabial folds bilaterally.  As such, we then carried out the dissection after injecting local as noted and we used a 15 blade scalpel to create our incision along the lateral canthus along its preexisting incision.  We carried this down to the lateral orbital rim again elevating the periosteum taking care to preserve infraorbital nerve.,At this point, we then released the periosteum distally just at the level of the nasolabial fold and placed our Endotine midface implant into the desired area and then elevated slightly just for symmetry only.  This was then secured in place using the bioabsorbable screw and then resected a very marginal amount of tissue just for removal of the dog ear deformity and closed the deeper layers of tissue using 3-0 PDS and then closing the extension to the subciliary area using 5-0 plain gut and then 6-0 Prolene lateral to the canthus.,At this point, we felt that we had achieved improved contour, improved symmetry, and decreased effacement of the nasolabial fold and alar crease.  Satisfied with our procedures, we then placed cool compresses on to the eyes.,The patient was then extubated and brought to the PACU in stable condition.,Dr. X was present and scrubbed for the entire case and actively participated during all key elements.

He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.  The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.  A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.,The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.

On physical examination, she was derived to have a severely deviated septum with an S-shape deformity as well as turbinate hypertrophy present along the inferior turbinates contributing to the obstruction.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operating Suite where she was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away.  Nasal pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavities.  These were then removed and the nasal septum as well as the turbinates were localized with the mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100000 epinephrine solution.  The nasal pledgets were then reinserted as the patient was prepped in the usual fashion.  The nasal pledgets were again removed and the turbinates as well as an infraorbital nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  The nasal vestibules were then cleansed with a pHisoHex solution.  A #15 blade scalpel was then used to make an incision along the length of the caudal septum.  The mucoperichondrial junction was then identified with the aid of cotton-tipped applicator as well as the stitch scissor.  Once the plane was identified, the mucosal flap on the left side of the septum was elevated with the aid of a Cottle.  At this point it should be mentioned that the patient's septum was significantly deviated with a large S-shape deformity obstructing both the right and left nasal cavity with the convex portion present in the left nasal cavity.  Again, the Cottle elevator was used to raise the mucosal flap down to the level of the septal spur.  At this point, the septal knife was used to make a crossover incision through the cartilage just anterior to the septal spur.  Again, the mucosal flap was elevated in the right nasal septum.  Now Knight scissors were used to remove the ascending portion of the nasal cartilage, which was then removed with a Takahashi forceps.  A Cottle elevator was used to further elevate the mucosal flap off the septal spur on the left side.  Removal of the spur was performed with the aid of the septal knife as well as a 3 mm straight chisel.  Once all ascending cartilage has been removed, inspection of the nasal cavity revealed patent passages with the exception of inferior turbinates that were very hypertrophied and was felt to be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinates were again localized and a #15 blade scalpel was used to make a vertical incision dissected down to the chondral bone.  The XPS microdebrider with the inferior turbinate blade was then inserted through the incision and a submucous resection was performed by passing the microdebrider along the length of the bone.  Once the submucosal tissue had been resected, an outfracture procedure was performed so as to fully open the nasal passages.  Inspection revealed very patent and nonobstructive nasal passages.  Now the caudal incision was reapproximated with #4-0 chromic suture.  Finally, a #4-0 fast absorbing plain gut suture was used to approximate the mucosal surface of the septum in a running whipstitch fashion.  Finally, Merocel packing was placed and the patient was retuned to the Department of Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.","surgery, chronic nasal obstruction, nasal septum, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, nasal septal reconstruction, submucous resection, inferior turbinates, outfracture, nasal septal, nasal pledgets, nasal cavity, nasal obstruction, turbinate hypertrophy, mucosal flap, septal, septum, turbinates, nasal, cavity, chronic, hypertrophy, obstruction, mucosal,"

The pressure on the right was 17 mmHg and on the left was 16 mmHg.,A punctal dilator was then used to dilate the left superior puncta.  A size 00 Bowman probe was used to navigate the superior puncta and canaliculus with traction of the eyelid temporally.  The probe was advanced until a firm stop of the lacrimal bone was felt.  The probe was rotated in a superior and medial fashion along the brow to allow for navigation through the nasolacrimal sac and duct.  A mild resistance was felt at the distal aspect of the nasolacrimal duct consistent with a location of the valve.  There was also some mild stenosis distally, but not felt significant.  The probe was used to navigate through this mild resistance.  A second Bowman probe was then placed through the left naris and metal on metal contact was felt confirming patency.  Both probes were removed.  The 00 Bowman probe was then used to navigate the inferior puncta canaliculus system.  Patency was confirmed.  The left upper lid was everted and inspected and was found to be normal.,Attention was then turned to the right side where the similar procedure through the right superior puncta was performed.  A punctal dilator was used to dilate the puncta followed by a size 00 Bowman probe.  Again on this side, a size 0 Bowman probe was unable to be placed initially to the superior puncta.  The probe was used to navigate the superior puncta, canaliculus, and then the probe was rotated superomedially and the probe was advanced.  Similar amount of distal stenosis and distal nasolacrimal duct obstruction was felt.  The mild resistance was over come at the approximate location of the valve.  Metal-on-metal feel confirmed patency through the right naris with a second metal probe.  At the completion of the procedure all probes were removed.  Awakened and taken to the postanesthesia recovery unit in good condition having tolerated the procedure well.,Postoperative instructions were provided to the parents by me, and the discharging nurse.  I did advised nasolacrimal massage for the next 7 to 10 days on each side two to three times daily.  Technique explained and demonstrated.

He has a left nasal obstruction and depressed left nasal bone.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was given general endotracheal anesthesia and monitored with pulse oximetry, EKG, and CO2 monitors.,The face was prepped with Betadine soap and solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  Nasal mucosa was decongested using Afrin pledgets as well as 1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into bilateral nasal septal mucoperichondrium and the nasal dorsum, lateral osteotomy sites.,Inspection revealed caudal portion of the cartilaginous septum lying crosswise across the nasal spine area and columella causing obstruction of the left nasal valve.  Further up, the cartilaginous septum was displaced to the left of the maxillary crest.  There was a large maxillary crest and supramaxillary crest had a large spur with the vomer bone touching the inferior turbinate.,There was a large deep groove horizontally on the right side corresponding to the left maxillary crest.,A left hemitransfixion incision was made.  Mucoperichondrium was elevated from left side of the cartilaginous septum and mucoperiosteum was elevated from the ethmoid plate.  Vomer and inferior tunnel was created at the floor of the left side of the nose to connect the anterior and inferior tunnels, which was rather difficult at the area of the vomerine spur, which was very sharp and touching the inferior turbinate.,The caudal cartilaginous septum, which was lying crosswise, was separated from the main cartilage leaving approximately 1 cm strut.  The right side mucoperichondrium was released from the cartilaginous septum as well as ethmoid plate and the maxillary crest area.,The caudal cartilaginous strut was sutured to the columella with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut suture to bring it into the midline.,Further back, the cartilaginous septum anterior to the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side, so it was freed from the maxillary crest, nasal dorsum, from the ethmoid plate, and was sutured in the midline with a transfixion #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,Further posteriorly, the ethmoid plate was deviated to the left side and portion of it was removed with Jansen-Middleton punch forceps.,The main deviation was also caused by the vomerine crest and the maxillary crest and supramaxillary cartilaginous cartilage.,This area was freed from the perichondrium on both sides.  The maxillary crest was removed with a gouge.  Vomer was partially removed with a gouge and the rest of the vomer was displaced back into the midline.,Thus, the deviated septum was corrected.  Left hemitransfixion incisions were closed with interrupted #4-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The septum was also filtered with #4-0 plain catgut sutures.,By valve, septal splints were tied to the septum bilaterally with a transfixion #5-0 nylon suture.,Next, the nasal bone suture deviated to the left side were corrected.  The right nasal bone was depressed and left nasal bone was wide.  Therefore, the nasal bones were refractured back into the midline by compressing the left nasal bone and elevating the right nasal bone with the nasal bone elevator through the nasal cavities.  The left intercartilaginous incision was made and the nasal bones were disimpacted subperiosteally and they were molded back into the midline.,Steri-Strips were applied to the nasal dorsal skin and a Denver type of splint was applied to the nasal dorsal to stabilize the nasal bones.,Nasal cavities were packed with Telfa gauze rolled on both sides with bacitracin ointment.  Approximate blood loss was 10 to 20 mL.","surgery, nasal fracture, deviated nasal septum, nasal septoplasty, nasal bones, ethmoid plate, cartilaginous septum, nasal bone, maxillary crest, septum, nasal, fracture, maxillary, cartilaginous, crest, "

With the additional conductive loss secondary to the retraction of the tympanic membrane, her hearing aid and function deteriorated significantly.  So, we have kept sets of tubes in her ears at all times.  The major problem is that she has got small ear canals and a very sensitive external auditory canal; therefore it cannot tolerate even the wax cleaning in the clinic awake.,The patient was seen in the OR and tubes were placed.  There were no significant findings.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, she was brought to the neurosensory OR, placed under general anesthesia.  Mask airway was used.  IV had already been started.,On the right side, we removed the old tube and then cleaned the cerumen and found that it was larger than the side of the tube in perfection or perforation in tympanic membrane in the anterior inferior quadrant.

Left heart catheterization, left ventriculogram, aortogram, coronary angiogram.,2.  PCI of the LAD and left main coronary artery with Impella assist device.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , Unstable angina and congestive heart failure with impaired LV function.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 7-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery and a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral vein.  Through the arterial sheath, angiography of the right common femoral artery was obtained.  Thereafter, 6-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the distal aorta where angiography of the distal aorta and the bifurcation of the right and left common iliac arteries was obtained.  Thereafter, a 4-French sheath was introduced into the left common femoral artery using modified Seldinger technique.  Thereafter, the pigtail catheter was advanced over an 0.035-inch J-wire into the left ventricle and LV-gram was performed in RAO view and after pullback, an aortogram was performed in the LAO view.  Therefore, a 6-French JL4 and JR4 guiding catheters were used to engage the left and right coronary arteries respectively and multiple orthogonal views of the coronary arteries were obtained.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  ,1.  LV-gram:  LVEDP was 15 mmHg.  LV ejection fraction 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis.  Only anterior wall is contracting.  There was no mitral regurgitation.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback, and on aortography, there was no evidence of aortic dissection or aortic regurgitation.,2.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessels with a mid 50% to 70% stenosis which was not treated.  The left main coronary artery calcified vessel with disease.,2.  The left anterior descending artery had an 80% to 90% mid-stenosis.  First diagonal branch had a more than 90% stenosis.,3.  The circumflex coronary artery had a patent stent.,INTERVENTION: , After reviewing the angiographic images, we elected to proceed with intervention of the left anterior descending artery.  The 4-French sheath in the left common femoral artery was upsized to a 12-French Impella sheath through which an Amplatz wire and a 6-French multipurpose catheter were advanced into the left ventricle.  The Amplatz wire was exchanged for an Impella 0.018-inch stiff wire.  The multipurpose catheter was removed, and the Impella was advanced into the left ventricle and a performance level of 8 was achieved with a cardiac output of 2 to 2.5 l/min.  Thereafter, a 7-French JL4 guiding catheter was used to engage the left coronary artery and an Asahi soft 0.014-inch wire was advanced into the left anterior descending artery and a second 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire was advanced into the diagonal branch.  The diagonal branch was predilated with a 2.5 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon at nominal atmospheres and thereafter a 2.5 x 24 Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD and a 3.0 x 15-mm Endeavor stent was deployed in the proximal LAD.  The stent delivery balloon was used to post-dilate the overlapping segment.  The LAD, the diagonal was rewires with an 0.014-inch Asahi soft wire and a 3.0 x 20-mm Maverick balloon was advanced into the LAD for post-dilatation and a 2.0 x 30-mm Sprinter balloon was advanced into the diagonal for kissing inflations which were performed at nominal atmospheres.  At this point, it was noted that the left main had a retrograde dissection.  A 3.5 x 18-mm Endeavor stent was successfully deployed in the left main coronary artery.  The Asahi soft wire in the diagonal was removed and placed into the circumflex coronary artery.  Kissing inflations of the LAD and the circumflex coronary artery were performed using 3.0 x 20 Maverick balloons x2 balloons, inflated at high atmospheres of 14.,RESULTS: , Lesion reduction in the LAD FROM 90% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the diagonal from 90% to less than 60% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.  Lesion reduction in the left maintained coronary artery from 50% to 0% and TIMI 3 flow obtained.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and the inflations well with no evidence of any hemodynamic instability.  The Impella device was gradually decreased from performance level of 8 to performance level of 1 at which point it was removed into the aorta and it was turned off and the Impella was removed from the body and the 2 Perclose sutures were tightened.  From the right common femoral artery, a 6-French IMA catheter was advanced and an 0.035-inch wire down into the left common femoral and superficial femoral artery, over which an 8 x 40 balloon was advanced and tamponade of the arteriotomy site of the left common femoral artery was performed from within the artery at 3 atmospheres for a total of 20 minutes.  The right common femoral artery and vein sheaths were both sutured in place for further observation.

Mitral valve posterior annuloplasty using a Cosgrove Galloway Medtronic fuser band.,3.  Posterior leaflet abscess resection.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia,TIMES:  ,Aortic cross-clamp time was ** minutes.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time total was ** minutes.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Next, the patient's chest and legs were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  A #10-blade scalpel was used to make a midline median sternotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the sternum using Bovie electrocautery.  The sternum was opened with a sternal saw, and full-dose heparinization was given.  Next, the chest retractor was positioned.  The pericardium was opened with Bovie electrocautery and pericardial stay sutures were positioned.  We then prepared to place the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass.  A 2-0 Ethibond double pursestring was placed in the ascending aorta.  Through this was passed our aortic cannula and connected to the arterial side of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  Next, double cannulation with venous cannulas was instituted.  A 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the right atrial appendage.  Through this was passed our SEC cannula.  This was connected to the venous portion of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine in a Y-shaped circuit.  Next, a 3-0 Prolene pursestring was placed in the lower border of the right atrium.  Through this was passed our inferior vena cava cannula.  This was likewise connected to the Y connection of our venous cannula portion.  We then used a 4-0 U-stitch in the right atrium for our retrograde cardioplegia catheter, which was inserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect out the SVC and IVC, which were subsequently encircled with umbilical tape.  Sondergaard's groove was taken down.  Next, an antegrade cardioplegia needle and associated sump were placed in the ascending aorta.  This was connected appropriately as was the retrograde cardioplegia catheter.  Next, the aorta was cross-clamped, and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia was infused so as to arrest the heart in diastole.  Next a #15-blade scalpel was used to open the left atrium.  The left atrium was decompressed with pump sucker.  Next, our self-retaining retractor was positioned so as to bring the mitral valve up into view.  Of note was the fact that the mitral valve P2 segment of the posterior leaflet had an abscess associated with it.  The borders of the P2 segment abscess were defined by using a right angle to define the chordae which were encircled with a 4-0 silk.  After doing so, the P2 segment of the posterior leaflet was excised with a #11-blade scalpel.  Given the laxity of the posterior leaflet, it was decided to reconstruct it with a 2-0 Ethibond pledgeted suture.  This was done so as to reconstruct the posterior annular portion.  Prior to doing so, care was taken to remove any debris and abscess-type material.  The pledgeted stitch was lowered into place and tied.  Next, the more anterior portion of the P2 segment was reconstructed by running a 4-0 Prolene stitch so as to reconstruct it.  This was done without difficulty.  The apposition of the anterior and posterior leaflet was confirmed by infusing solution into the left ventricle.  There was noted to be a small amount of central regurgitation.  It was felt that this would be corrected with our annuloplasty portion of the procedure.  Next, 2-0 non-pledgeted Ethibond sutures were placed in the posterior portion of the annulus from trigone to trigone in interrupted fashion.  Care was taken to go from trigone to trigone.  Prior to placing these sutures, the annulus was sized and noted to be a *** size for the Cosgrove-Galloway suture band ring from Medtronic.  After, as mentioned, we placed our interrupted sutures in the annulus, and they were passed through the CG suture band.  The suture band was lowered into position and tied in place.  We then tested our repair and noted that there was very mild regurgitation.  We subsequently removed our self-retaining retractor.  We closed our left atriotomy using 4-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  This was done without difficulty.  We de-aired the heart.  We then gave another round of antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia in warm fashion.  The aortic cross-clamp was removed, and the heart gradually resumed electromechanical activity.  We then removed our retrograde cardioplegia catheter from the coronary sinus and buttressed this site with a 5-0 Prolene.  We placed 2 ventricular and 2 atrial pacing leads which were brought out through the skin.  The patient was gradually weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass and our venous cannulas were removed.  We then gave full-dose protamine; and after noting that there was no evidence of a protamine reaction, we removed our aortic cannula.  This site was buttressed with a 4-0 Prolene on an SH needle.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  We placed a mediastinal #32-French chest tube as well as a right chest Blake drain.  The mediastinum was inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There were none.  We closed the sternum with #7 sternal wires in interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The fascia was closed with a #1 Vicryl followed by a 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 3-0 Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition.","surgery, mitral valve repair, mitral valve, abscess resection, leaflet abscess, cosgrove galloway medtronic, bovie electrocautery, cannulation, bypass, annuloplasty, cardioplegia, mitral"

Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement.,2.  Anterior acromioplasty.,3.  Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.","surgery, slap lesion, acromioclavicular joint, impingement syndrome, mumford procedure, acromioplasty, arthroscopy, arthroscopic, arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement, anterior acromioplasty, rotator cuff tear, arthroscopic rotator, meniscal shaver, cuff tear, rotator cuff, debridement, osteoarthritis, acromioclavicular, clavicle, deltoid, rotator, cuff, shoulder, joint"

Transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty with removal of a portion of the medial and middle fat pad.,ANESTHESIA: , General via endotracheal tube.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , The patient is a 28-year-old country and western performer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident over a year ago.  Since that time, she is felt to have facial asymmetry, which is apparent in publicity photographs for her record promotions.  She had requested a procedure to bring about further facial asymmetry.  She was seen preoperatively by psychiatrist specializing in body dysmorphic disorder as well as analysis of the patient's requesting cosmetic surgery and was felt to be a psychiatrically good candidate.  She did have facial asymmetry with the bit of more fullness in higher cheekbone on the right as compared to the left.  Preoperative workup including CT scan failed to show any skeletal trauma.  The patient was counseled with regard to the risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of the postsurgical procedure including but not limited to bleeding, infection, unacceptable cosmetic appearance, numbness of the face, change in sensation of the face, facial nerve paralysis, need for further surgery, need for revision, hair loss, etc., and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position after having been marked in the upright position while awake.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced with a #6 endotracheal tube.  All appropriate measures were taken to preserve the vocal cords in a professional singer.  Local anesthesia consisting of 5/6th 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine in 1/6th 0.25% Marcaine was mixed and then injected in a regional field block fashion in the subperiosteal plane via the gingivobuccal sulcus injection on either side as well as into the temporal fossa at the level of the true temporal fascia.  The upper eyelids were injected with 1 cc of 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 units of epinephrine.  Adequate time for vasoconstriction and anesthesia was allowed to be obtained.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 4-0 silk suture was placed in the right lower lid.  For traction, it was brought anteriorly.  The conjunctiva was incised with the needle tip Bovie with Jaeger lid plate protecting the cornea and globe.  A Q-Tip was then used to separate the orbicularis oculi muscle from the fat pad beneath and carried down to the bone.  The middle and medial fat pads were identified and a small amount of fat was removed from each to take care of the pseudofat herniation, which was present.  The inferior oblique muscle was identified, preserved, and protected throughout the procedure.  The transconjunctival incision was then closed with buried knots of 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results and throughout the procedure.  Lacri-Lube was in the eyes in order to maintain hydration.  Attention was next turned to the midface, where a temporal incision was made parallel to the nasojugal folds.  Dissection was carried out with the hemostat down to the true temporal fascia and the endoscopic temporal dissection dissector was used to elevate the true temporal fascia.  A 30-degree endoscope was used to visualize the fat pads, so that we knew we are in the proper plane.  Subperiosteal dissection was carried out over the zygomatic arch and Whitnall's tubercle and the temporal dissection was completed.,Next, bilateral gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were made and a Joseph elevator was used to elevate the periosteum of the midface and anterior face of the maxilla from the tendon of the masseter muscle up to Whitnall's tubercle.  The two dissection planes within joint in the subperiosteal fashion and dissection proceeded laterally out to the zygomatic neurovascular bundle.  It was bipolar electrocauteried and the tunnel was further dissected free and opened.  The endotine 4.5 soft tissue suspension device was then inserted through the temporal incision, brought down into the subperiosteal midface plane of dissection.  The guard was removed and the suspension spikes were engaged into the soft tissues.  The spikes were elevated superiorly such that a symmetrical midface elevation was carried out bilaterally.  The endotine device was then secured to the true temporal fascia with three sutures of 3-0 PDS suture.  Contralateral side was treated in similar fashion with like results in order to achieve facial symmetry and symmetry was obtained.  The gingivobuccal sulcus incisions were closed with interrupted 4-0 chromic and the scalp incision was closed with staples.  The sterile dressing was applied.

It was unclear from her previous operative records and CT scan as to whether or not she was a reconstruction candidate.  She had reports of stapes fixation as well as otosclerosis on her CT scan.,At surgery, she was found to have a mobile malleus handle, but her stapes was fixed by otosclerosis.  There was no incus.  There was no specific round window niche.  There was a very minute crevice; however, exploration of this area did not reveal a niche to a round window membrane.  The patient had a type of TORP prosthesis, which had tilted off the footplate anteriorly underneath the malleus handle.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative room and placed in supine position.  The right face, ear, and neck prepped with ***** alcohol solution.  The right ear was draped in the sterile field.  External auditory canal was injected with 1% Xylocaine with 1:50,000 epinephrine.  A Fisch indwelling incision was made and a tympanomeatal flap was developed in a 12 o'clock to the 7 o'clock position.  Meatal skin was elevated, middle ear was entered.  This exposure included the oval window, round window areas.  There was a good cartilage graft in place and incorporated into the posterior superior ***** of the drum.  The previous prosthesis was found out of position as it had tilted out of position anteriorly, and there was no contact with the footplate.  The prosthesis was removed without difficulty.  The patient's stapes had an arch, but the ***** was atrophied.  Malleus handle was mobile.  The footplate was fixed.  Consideration have been given to performing a stapedectomy with a tissue seal and then returning later for prosthesis insertion; however, upon inspection of the round window area, there was found to be no definable round window niche, no round window membrane.  The patient was felt to have obliterated otosclerosis of this area along with the stapes fixation.  She is not considered to be a reconstruction candidate under the current circumstances.  No attempt was made to remove bone from the round window area.  A different style of Goldenberg TORP was placed on the footplate underneath the cartilage support in hopes of transferring some sound conduction from the tympanic membrane to the footplate.  The fit was secure and supported with Gelfoam in the middle ear.  The tympanomeatal flap was returned to anatomic position supported with Gelfoam saturated Ciprodex.  The incision was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and individual #5-0 nylon to the skin, and a sterile dressing was applied.","surgery, conductive hearing loss, goldenberg, meatal skin, torp, torp reconstruction, ear, ear exploration, handle, malleus, otosclerosis, sensorineural, stapedectomy, tympanomeatal, middle ear exploration, hearing loss, malleus handle, middle ear, middle"

Adenocarcinoma of the prostate., Surgery, Mini Laparotomy & Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Mini-laparotomy radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection with Cavermap.,ANESTHESIA: , General by intubation.,Informed consent was obtained for the procedure.  The patient understands the treatment options and wishes to proceed.  He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.  Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.","surgery, mini-laparotomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, pelvic lymph, pelvic lymph node dissection, cavermap, mini laparotomy, prostatectomy, bladder, intubation, adenocarcinoma, endopelvic, hemostasis, neck"

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.","surgery, double lumen endotracheal, en bloc resection, malignant mesothelioma, lung mass, endotracheal tube, chest tube, bovie cautery, en bloc, diaphragm, lobectomy, mesothelioma, thoracotomy, "

Exact etiology of her ear pain had not been identified.  A fiberoptic examination had been performed in the office.  Upon examination, she was noted to have fullness in the right base of her tongue.  She was counseled on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery and consented to such.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Operative Suite where she was placed in supine position.  General endotracheal tube intubation was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where a shoulder roll was placed.  A tooth guard was then placed to protect the upper dentition.  The Dedo laryngoscope was then inserted into the oral cavity.  It was advanced on the right lateral pharyngeal wall until the epiglottis was brought into view.  At this point, it was advanced underneath the epiglottis until the vocal cords were seen.  At this point, it was suspended via the Lewy suspension arm from the Mayo stand.  At this point, the Zeiss microscope with a 400 mm lens was brought into the surgical field.  Inspection of the vocal cords underneath the microscope revealed them to be white and glistening without any mucosal abnormalities.  It should be mentioned that the right vocal cord did appear to be slightly more hyperemic, however, there were no mucosal abnormalities identified.  This was confirmed with a laryngeal probe as well as use of mirror evaluated in the subglottic portion as well as the ventricle.  At this point, the scope was desuspended and the microscope was removed.  The scope was withdrawn through the vallecular region.  Inspection of the vallecula revealed a fullness on the right side with a papillomatous type growth that appeared very friable.  Biopsies were obtained with straight-biting cup forceps.  Once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was advanced into the piriform sinuses.  Again in the right piriform sinus, there was noted to be studding along the right lateral wall of the piriform sinus.  Again, biopsies were performed and once hemostasis was achieved, the scope was further withdrawn down the lateral pharyngeal wall.  There were no mucosal abnormalities identified within the oropharynx.  The scope was then completely removed and a bimanual examination was performed.  No neck masses were identified.  At this point, the procedure was complete.  The mouth guard was removed and the patient was returned to Anesthesia for awakening and taken to the recovery room without incident.","surgery, microsuspension, laryngoscopy, otalgia, ear pain, fiberoptic, dedo laryngoscope, epiglottis, direct laryngoscopy, piriform sinuses, tongue, microscope, mucosal, abnormalities, fullness, ear, scope "

The patient had been followed for a period of time and underwent rapid development of a left and right infraclavicular lymphadenopathy and central neck lymphadenopathy also with imaging studies to suggest superior mediastinal disease.  Fine-needle aspiration of the left and right infraclavicular lymph nodes revealed persistent medullary thyroid cancer.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedures discussed with in detail and the patient elected to proceed with surgery as discussed.  The risks included, but not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerve, lip, tongue, shoulder, weakness, tongue numbness, droopy eyelid, tumor comes back, need for additional treatment, diaphragm weakness, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, others.  The patient understood all these issues and did wish to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  The patient was intubated with a number 7 nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube.  The eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  The patient was rotated to 180 degrees towards the operating surgeon.  The Foley catheter was placed into the bladder with good return of urine.  Attention then was turned to securing the nerve integrity monitor system endotracheal tube and this was confirmed to be working adequately.  A previous apron incision was incorporated and advanced over onto the right side to the mastoid tip.  The incision then was planned around the old scar to be excised.  A 1% lidocaine with 1 to 100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied.  The incision was made, the apron flap was raised to the level of the mandible and mastoid tip bilaterally all the way down to the clavicle and sternal notch inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to performing the level 1 dissection on the left.  Subsequently the marginal mandibular nerve was identified over the facial notch of the mandible.  The facial artery and vein were individually ligated and marginal mandibular nerve traced superiorly and perifascial lymph nodes freed from the marginal mandibular nerve.  Level 1A lymph nodes of the submental region were dissected off the mylohyoid and digastric.  The submandibular gland was appreciated and retracted laterally.  The mylohyoid muscle appreciated.  The lingual nerve was appreciated and the submandibular ganglion was ligated.  The hypoglossal nerve was appreciated and protected and digastric tunnel was then made posteriorly and the lymph nodes posterior along the marginal mandibular nerve and into the parotid gland were then dissected and incorporated into the specimen for histopathologic analysis.  The marginal mandibular nerve stimulated at the completion of this portion of the procedure.  Attention was then turned to incising the fascia along the clavicle on the left side.  Dissection then ensued along the floor of the neck palpating a very large bulky lymph node before the neck was identified.  The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve were identified.  The internal jugular vein identified and the mass was freed from the floor of the neck with careful dissection and suture ligation of vessels.  Attention was then turned to the central neck.  The strap muscles were appreciated in the midline.  There was a large firm mass measuring approximately 3 cm that appeared to be superior to the strap musculature.  A careful dissection with incorporation of a portion of the sternal hyoid muscle in this area for a margin was then performed.  Attention was then turned to identify the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein on the left side.  This was traced inferiorly, internal jugular vein to the brachiocephalic vein.  Palpation deep to this area into the mediastinum and up against the trachea revealed a 1.5 cm lymph node mass.  Subsequently this was carefully dissected preserving the brachiocephalic vein and also the integrity of the trachea and the carotid artery and these lymph nodes were removed in full and sent for histopathologic analysis.  Attention was then turned to the right neck dissection.  A posterior flap on the right was raised to the anterior border of the trapezius.  The accessory nerve was identified in the posterior triangle and traced superiorly and inferiorly.  Attention was then turned to identifying the submandibular gland.  A digastric tunnel was performed back to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right side was incised and the omohyoid muscle was appreciated.  The omohyoid muscle was retracted inferiorly.  Penrose drain was placed around the inferior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  Subsequently the internal jugular vein was identified.  The external jugular vein ligated about 1 cm above the clavicle.  Palpation in this area and the infraclavicular region on the right revealed a firm irregular lymph node complex.  Dissection along the floor of the neck then was performed to allow for mobilization.  The transverse cervical artery and vein were individually ligated to allow full mobilization of this mass.  Tissue between the phrenic nerve and the internal jugular vein was clamped and suture ligated.  The tissue was then brought posteriorly from the trapezius muscle to the internal jugular vein and traced superiorly.  The cervical rootlets were transected after the contribution, so the phrenic nerve all the way superiorly to the skull base.  The hypoglossal nerve was identified and protected as the lymph node packet was dissected over the internal jugular vein.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  No bleeding points identified.  The wound was then prepared for closure.  Two number 10 JPs were placed through the left supraclavicular fossa in the previous drain sites and secured with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was closed  with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for platysma, subsequently a 4-0 running Biosyn for the skin, and Indermil.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated on the operating room table, and sent to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition.","surgery, lymphadenopathy, thyroid, infraclavicular, fossa, lymph nodes, dissection, pretracheal, internal jugular vein, infraclavicular lymphadenopathy, metastatic lymphadenopathy, mandibular nerve, vein, nodes, neck, nerve, muscle, jugularNOTE"

The patient states she has had inability to bear significant weight and had swelling, popping, and giving away, failing conservative treatment and underwent an operative procedure.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the Operative Suite at ABCD General Hospital on 09/08/03, placed on the operative table in supine position.  Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the right lower extremity was placed in a Johnson knee holder.  Care was ensured that all bony prominences were well padded and she was positioned and secured.  After adequately positioned, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Attention was then directed to creation of the arthroscopic portals, both medial and lateral portal were made for arthroscope and instrumentation respectively.  The arthroscope was advanced through the inferolateral portal taking in a suprapatellar pouch.  All compartments were then examined in sequential order with photodocumentation of each compartment.  The patella was noted to have grade-II changes of the inferior surface, otherwise appeared to track within the trochlear groove.  There was mild grooving of the trochlear cartilage.  The medial gutter was visualized.  There was no evidence of loose body.  The medial compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a large defect on the medial femoral condyle grade III-IV chondromalacia changes with exposed bone in evidence of osteochondral displaced fragment.  There was also noted to be a degenerative meniscal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus.  The arthroscopic probe was then introduced and the meniscus and chondral surfaces were probed throughout its entirety and photos were taken.  At this point, a meniscal shaver was then introduced and the chondral surfaces were debrided as well as any loose bodies removed.  This gave a smooth shoulder to the chondral lesion.  After this, the meniscus was debrided until it had been smooth over the frayed edges.  At this point, the shaver was removed.  The meniscal binder was then introduced and the meniscus was further debrided until the tear was adequately contained at this point.  The shaver was reintroduced and all particles were again removed and the meniscus was smoothed over the edge.  The probe was then reintroduced and the shaver removed, the meniscus was probed ___________ and now found to be stable.  At this point, attention was directed to the rest of the knee.  The ACL was examined.  It was intact and stable.  The lateral compartment was then entered.  There was noted to be a grade II-III changes of the lateral femoral condyle.  Again, with the edge of some friability at the shoulder of this cartilage lesion.  There was noted to be some mild degenerative fraying of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.  The probe was introduced and the remaining meniscus appeared stable.  This was then removed and the stapler was introduced.  A chondroplasty and meniscoplasty were then performed until adequately debrided and smoothed over.  The lateral gutter was then visualized.  There was no evidence of loose bodies.  Attention was then redirected back to the medial and femoral condyles.,At this point, a 0.62 K-wire was then placed in through the initial portal, medial portal, as well as an additional poke hole, so we can gain access and proper orientation to the medial femoral lesion.  Microfacial technique was then used to introduce the K-wire into the subchondral bone in multiple areas until we had evidence of some bleeding to allow ___________ of this lesion.  After this was performed, the shaver was then reintroduced and the loose bodies and loose fragments were further debrided.  At this point, the shaver was then moved to the suprapatellar pouch and the patellar chondroplasty was then performed until adequately debrided.  Again, all compartments were then re-visualized and there was no further evidence of other pathology or loose bodies.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All instrumentation was removed.  Approximately 20 cc of 0.25% plain Marcaine was injected into the portal site and the remaining portion intraarticular.  Sterile dressings of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were then applied.  The patient was then transferred back to the gurney in supine position.,DISPOSITION:  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.  The patient was transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.",

Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.  The patient was then brought in the supine position and extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entire procedure which was right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsies.,The counts were correct x2 at the end of the case.","surgery, double-lumen, endotracheal, pleural surface, chest tube, pleural biopsy, malignant mesothelioma, vats pleurodesis, pleural biopsies, pleural effusion, pleural, vats, pleurodesis, mesothelioma,"

The patient agreed based on the risks and the benefits of the procedure, which were presented to him and was taken to the operating room.  A correct time out procedure was performed.  The patient was placed into the supine position.  He was given general anesthesia, was endotracheally intubated without incident with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to perform confirmation of adequate placement of the double-lumen tube.  Following this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was rolled into the right lateral decubitus position with the left side up.  All pressure points were padded.  The patient had a sterile DuraPrep preparation to the left chest.  A sterile drape around that was applied.  Also, the patient had Marcaine infused into the incision area.  Following this, the patient had a posterolateral thoracotomy incision, which was a muscle-sparing incision with a posterior approach just over the ausculatory triangle.  The incision was approximately 10 cm in size.  This was created with a 10-blade scalpel.  Bovie electrocautery was used to dissect the subcutaneous tissues.  The auscultatory triangle was opened.  The posterior aspect of the latissimus muscle was divided from the adjacent tissue and retracted anteriorly.  The muscle was not divided.  After the latissimus muscle was retracted anteriorly, the ribs were counted, and the sixth rib was identified.  The superior surface of the sixth rib was incised with Bovie electrocautery and the sixth rib was divided with rib shears.  Following this, the patient had the entire intercostal muscle separated from the superior aspect of the sixth rib on the left as far as the Bovie would reach.  The left lung was allowed to collapse and meticulous inspection of the left lung identified the lesions, which were taken out with stapled wedge resections via a TA30 green load stapler for all of the wedges.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The largest lesion was the left upper lobe apex lesion, which was possibly multiple lesions, which was taken in one large wedge segment, and this was also adjacent to another area of the wedges.  The patient had multiple pleural abnormalities, which were identified on the surface of the lung.  These were small white spotty looking lesions and were not confirmed to be tumor implants, but were suspicious to be multiple areas of tumor.  Based on this, the wedges of the tumors that were easily palpable were excised with complete excision of all palpable lesions.  Following this, the patient had a 32-French chest tube placed in the anteroapical position.  A 19-French Blake was placed in the posterior apical position.  The patient had the intercostal space reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture, and the lung was allowed to be re-expanded under direct visualization.  Following this, the chest tubes were placed to Pleur-evac suction and the auscultatory triangle was closed with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The deeper tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with running 4-0 Monocryl suture in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no complications.",

For this reason, Dr. X and I agreed to operate on this patient together.  Please note that two surgeons were required for this case due to the complexity of it.  The indications and risks of the procedure were explained and the patient gave her informed consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was given with a double lumen tube.  The patient was positioned for a left thoracotomy.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A muscle sparing incision was created several centimeters anterior to the tip of the scapula.  The serratus and latissimus muscles were retracted.  The intercostal space was opened.  We then created a thoracoscopy port inferiorly through which we placed a camera for lighting and for visualization.  Through our small anterior thoracotomy and with the video-assisted scope placed inferiorly we had good visualization of the posterior mediastinum mass.  This was in the upper portion of the mediastinum just posterior to the subclavian artery and aorta.  The lung was deflated and allowed to retract anteriorly.  With a combination of blunt and sharp dissection and with attention paid to hemostasis, we were able to completely resect the posterior mediastinal mass.  We began by opening the tumor and taking a very wide large biopsy.  This was sent for frozen section, which revealed a benign nerve sheath tumor.  Then, using the occluder device Dr. X was able to _____ the inferior portions of the mass.  This left the external surface of the mass much more malleable and easier to retract.  Using a bipolar cautery and endoscopic scissors we were then able to completely resect it.  Once the tumor was resected, it was then sent for permanent sections.  The entire hemithorax was copiously irrigated and hemostasis was complete.  In order to prevent any lymph leak, we used 2 cc of Evicel and sprayed this directly on to the raw surface of the pleural space.  A single chest tube was inserted through our thoracoscopy port and tunneled up one interspace.  The wounds were then closed in multiple layers.  A #2 Vicryl was used to approximate the ribs.  The muscles of the chest wall were allowed to return to their normal anatomic position.  A 19 Blake was placed in the subcutaneous tissues.  Subcutaneous tissues and skin were closed with running absorbable sutures.  The patient was then rolled in the supine position where she was awakened from general endotracheal anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, posterior mediastinal mass, neural foraminal, nerve sheath tumor, frozen section, thoracotomy, mediastinal mass, foraminal, neural, sheath, mediastinal, "

He had epicardial pacing wires removed at the bedside.  Shortly afterwards, he began to feel lightheaded and became pale and diaphoretic.  He was immediately rushed to the operating room for cardiac tamponade following removal of epicardial pacing wires.  He was transported immediately and emergently and remained awake and alert throughout the time period inspite of hypotension with the systolic pressure in the 60s-70s.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  His chest was prepped and draped prior to induction under general anesthesia.  Incision was made through the previous median sternotomy chest incision.  Wires were removed in the usual manner and the sternum was retracted.  There were large amounts of dark blood filling the mediastinal chest cavity.  Large amounts of clot were also removed from the pericardial well and chest.  Systematic exploration of the mediastinum and pericardial well revealed bleeding from the right atrial appendix at the site of the previous cannulation.  This was repaired with two horizontal mattress pledgeted #5-0 Prolene sutures.  An additional #0 silk tie was also placed around the base of the atrial appendage for further hemostasis.  No other sites of bleeding were identified.  The mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution.  Two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart, as well as straight mediastinal chest tube.  The sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running Vicryl sutures.  The skin was then closed with a running subcuticular stitch.  The patient was then taken to the Intensive Care Unit in a critical but stable condition.","surgery, mitral valve repair, exploration, median sternotomy chest incision, pericardial, mediastinal exploration, pacing wires, cardiac tamponade, chest tubes, mitral valve, valve repair, mediastinal, mitral, wires, atrium, repair,"

The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,SEDATION: , The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure.  Oxygenation was given.  The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.

The patient has had previous injections to the site which have caused the mass to decrease in size, however, the mass continues to be present and is irritated and painful with shoes.  The patient has requested surgical intervention at this time.,PROCEDURE:  ,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted from the preoperative holding area to the operating room.  The patient was then placed on the operating room table in the supine position and a towel was placed around the patient's abdomen and secured her to the table.  Using copious amounts of Webril, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied to her right ankle.  Using a Skin Skribe, the area of the soft tissue mass was outlined over the dorsum of her foot.  After adequate amount of anesthesia was provided by the Department of Anesthesia, a local ankle block was given using 10 cc of 4.5 mL of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1.0 mL of Solu-Medrol and the foot was scrubbed and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  Following this, the ankle was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot and the ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought back down to the table using bandage scissors.  The stockinette was reflected and the right foot was exposed.  Using a fresh #10 blade, a curvilinear incision was performed over the dorsum of the right foot.  Then using a #15 blade, the incision was deepened with care taken to identify and avoid or cauterize any bleeders which were noted.  Following this, the incision was deepened using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection and the muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle was identified.  Further dissection was then performed in the medial direction in the area of the soft tissue mass.  The intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve was identified and gently retracted laterally.  Large amounts of adipose tissue were noted medial to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle.  Using careful dissection, adipose tissue in this area was removed and saved for pathology.  Following removal of adipose tissue in this area and identification of no more adipose tissue, attention was directed lateral to the belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, which was also noted to have large amounts of adipose tissue in this area as well.  Using careful dissection, from the lateral border of the foot as much adipose tissue as possible was removed from this area as well and saved for pathology.  There was noted to be no other fluid-filled masses or lesions identifiable in this area then between the slits of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, careful dissection was performed to examine the underside of the belly of the muscle as well as structures beneath and no abnormal structures were identified here as well.  Following this, feeling adequately that no other mass remained in the area, the incision was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline.  The wound was then reinspected and all remaining tissues appeared healthy including the subcutaneous tissue.  The tendon and muscle belly of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle, the nerves of the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve and also the medial dorsal cutaneous nerve which were identified medially, all appeared intact.  No deficits were noted.  No abnormal appearing tissue was present within the surgical site.  Following this, the skin edges were reapproximated using #4-0 Vicryl deep closure of the subcutaneous layer was performed.  Then, using #4-0 nylon and simple interrupted suture, the skin was reapproximated and closed with care taken to ensure eversion of the skin edges and good approximation of the borders.  The patient was also given 7 cc of 1% lidocaine plain throughout the procedure to augment local anesthesia.  Following this, the wound was dressed using Xeroform gauze and 4x4s and was dressed using two ABD pads, dorsal and plantar for compression and using Kling, Kerlix and Coban.  The patient then had the ankle tourniquet deflated with a total tourniquet time of 55 minutes at 250 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to digits one through five of the right foot.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was noted to have vascular status intact.  The patient was then escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where she was placed in a surgical shoe.  The patient was then given postoperative instructions to include ice and elevation to her right foot.  The patient was cleared for ambulation as tolerated, but was instructed that with increased ambulation will come increased swelling and pain.

Right breast was slightly larger than the left this was repaired with a basic wise pattern reduction mammoplasty with anterior pedicle.,PROCEDURE,With the patient under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the entire chest was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A previously placed mark to identify the neo-nipple site was re-identified and carefully measured for asymmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  A keyhole wire ring was then used to outline the basic wise pattern with 6-cm lamps inferiorly.  This was then carefully checked for symmetry and appeared to be satisfactory.  All marks were then completed and lightly incised on both breasts.  The right breast was approached first.  The neo-nipple site was de-epithelialized superiorly and then the inferior pedicle was de-epithelialized using cutting cautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to carry down an incision along the inferior aspect of the periosteum starting immediately.  This was taken down to the prepectoral fashion dissected for short distance superiorly, and then blunt dissection was used to mobilize under the superior portion of the breast tissues to the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle.  There was very little bleeding with this procedure.  After this had been completed, attention was directed to the lateral side, and the inferior incision was made and taken down to the serratus.  Cautery dissection was then used to carry this up superiorly over the lateral edge of the pectoral muscle to communicate with the previous pocket.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut around the inferior pedicle completely freeing the superior breast from the inferior breast.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  After this had been completed, cutting cautery was used to cut along the superior edge of the redundant tissue and this was tapered under the superior flaps.  On the right side, there was a small palpable lobule, which had shown up on mammogram, but nothing except some fat density was identified.  This site had been previously marked carefully, and there were no unusual findings and the superior tissue was then sent out separately for pathology.  After this had been completed, final hemostasis obtained, and the wound was irrigated and a tagging suture placed to approximate the tissues.  The breast cleared and the nipple appeared good.,Attention was then directed to the left breast, which was completed in the similar manner.  After this had been completed, the patient was placed in a near upright position, and symmetry appeared good, but it was a bit poor on the lateral aspect of the right side, which was little larger and some suction lipectomy was carried out in this area.  After completion of this, 1860 grams had been removed from the right and 1505 grams was removed from the left.  Through separate stab wounds on the lateral aspect, 10-mm flat Blake drains were brought out and sutures were then placed **** and irrigated.  The wounds were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl on the deep dermis and running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl on the skin, packing sutures and staples were removed as they were approached.  The nipple was sutured with running intradermal 4-0 Monocryl.  Vascularity appeared good throughout.  After this had been completed, all wounds were cleaned and Steri-Stripped.

The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.

Right McBride bunionectomy.,2.  Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with IV sedation.,HEMOSTASIS: , With pneumatic ankle cuff.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position.  The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner.  Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure.  The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection.  Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp.  At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection.  Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments.  The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment.  At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete.  The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw.  The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted.  At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary.  The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption.  At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint.  At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge.  The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm.  The screw was placed following proper technique.  The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing.  A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy.  The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax.  The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed.  At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion.  The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site.  At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily.  The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion.  The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal.  The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.,The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided.

The breasts were prepped and draped with DuraPrep and iodine solution and then draped in appropriate sterile fashion.  Markings were then made in the standing position preoperatively.  The nipple areolar complex was drawn at the level of the anterior projection of the inframammary fold along the central margin of the breast.  A McKissock ring was utilized as a pattern.  It was centered over the new nipple position and the medial and lateral flaps were drawn tangential to the pigmented areola at a 40-degree angle.  Medial and lateral flaps were drawn 8 cm in length.  At the most medial and lateral extremity inframammary folds, a line was drawn to the lower level at the medial and lateral flaps.  On the left side, the epithelialization was performed about the 45-mm nipple-areolar complex within the confines of the superior-medially based dermal parenchymal pedicle.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed along the inframammary fold, and then cut was made medially and laterally.  The resection medially was perpendicular to the chest wall down to the areolar tissue overlying the pectoralis major muscle, and laterally, the resection was performed tangential to the chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue towards the axillary tail.  The pedicle was thinned as well, so it was 2-cm thick beneath the nipple-areolar complex and they were medially 4-cm thick at its base.  On the right side, 947 g of breast tissue was removed.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Identical procedure was performed on the opposite left side, again with a superiorly and inferiorly based dermal parenchymal pedicle with deepithelialization about the 45-mm diameter nipple-areolar complex.  Resection of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and glandular tissue was performed medially down to the chest overlying the pectoralis major muscle and laterally tangential to the chest wall towards the axillary tail setting the pedicle as well beneath the nipple areolar complex.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  With pedicle on the left, the breast issue on the left side was weighed at 758 g.  Hemostasis was achieved with cautery.  The patient was placed in the sitting position with wound partially closed and there appeared to be excellent symmetry between the right and left sides.  The nipple-areolar complex was transposed within the position and the medial and lateral flaps were brought together beneath the transposed nipple-areolar complex.  Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 PDS suture for deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl suture.  A Jackson-Pratt drain had been placed prior to final closure and secured with a 4-0 silk suture.  The wound had been irrigated prior to final closure as well with bacitracin irrigation solution prior to final cauterization.  Closure was performed with an anchor-shaped closure around the nipple-areolar complex, vertically of inframammary folds and across the inframammary folds.  Dressing was applied.  The suture line was treated with Dermabond.

She requested that surgical procedures to be performed for correction of these abnormalities.  As such, complications were explained to the patient including infection, bleeding, poor wound healing, and need for additional surgery.  The patient subsequently signed the consent and requested that Dr. W and associates to perform the procedure.,TECHNIQUE,The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position.  General anesthesia was induced and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The posterior thigh of the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  First, multiple serial small incisions less than 1 cm in length were made to the posterior aspect of the right thigh and sequential stripping of the varicose veins was performed.  Once these varicose veins had been completely stripped and avulsed, then next the wounds were then irrigated and were cleaned with wet and dry, and all the incisions were closed with the use of 5-0 Monocryl buried interrupted sutures.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, ABDs and a TED hose.  Next, the patient was then flipped back over onto the stretcher and placed on the operating table in a supine position.  The anterior chest was then prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Next, a 10 blade was placed through previous circumareolar incisions from a previous augmentation mammoplasty.  Dissection was carried out with a 10 blade and Bovie cautery until the pectoralis fascia was identified to both breasts.  Once the pectoralis muscle and fascia were identified, then a surgical plane was created in a subglandular layer.  The hemostasis was obtained to both breast pockets with the Bovie cautery and suction and irrigation was performed to bilateral breast pockets as well.  A sizer was used to identify the appropriate size of the silicone implant to be used.  This was determined to be approximately 435 cc bilaterally.  As such, two mammary gel silicone breast implants were placed in a subglandular muscle.  Additional dissection of the breast pockets were performed bilaterally and the patient was sequentially placed in the upright sitting position for evaluation of appropriate placement of the mammary gel silicone implants.  Once it was determined that the implants were appropriately selected and placed with the 435 cc silicon gel implant, the circumareolar incisions were closed in approximately 4-layered fashion closing the fascia, subcutaneous tissue, deep dermis, and a running dermal subcuticular for final skin closure.  This was performed with 3-0 Monocryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for running subcuticular.  The incisions were then dressed with Mastisol, Steri-Strips, and Xeroform and dressed with sample Kerlix.  Next, our attention was paid to the face where 25% TCA solution was applied to two locations; one on the left cheek and the other one on the right cheek, where a hyperpigmentation/melasma.  Several applications of the TCA peel was performed, and at the end of this, the frosting was noted to both spots.  At the end of the case, needle and instrument counts were correct.

On reviewing this pathology, it is mostly likely DCIS.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient who appeared to understand and agreed to proceed.  The patient desired MammoSite Radiation Therapy; therefore, the sentinel lymph node biopsy was incorporated into the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, and general LMA anesthesia was administered.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Prior to the procedure, she underwent nuclear medicine injection with technetium-99 and methylene blue.  Incision was made of the area of great uptake and the axilla and taken through the subcutaneous tissue with electric Bovie cautery.  Two sentinel lymph nodes were identified, one was blue and hot and the other was just hot.  These were sent to Pathology for touch prep.  Adequate hemostasis was obtained.  The wound was packed and attention was turned to the left breast.  Ultrasound was used to identify the marker and the mass within the breast and create an adequate anterior skin flap.  An elliptical incision was made roughly at approximately the 3 o'clock position secondary to subcutaneous tissues with electric Bovie cautery.  The mass was dissected off the surrounding tissue using Bovie cautery down to the level of the pectoralis fascia, which was incorporated within the specimen.  The specimen was completely removed and marked **** double deep, and a mini C-arm was used to confirm this.  The marker was well localized within the center of the specimen.  The fascia was then elevated off of the pectoralis muscle and closed loosely with the interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures to create a nice spherical cavity for the MammoSite radiation catheter.  The wound was then closed with a deep layer of interrupted 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch and 4-0 running Monocryl.

We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.,A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.","surgery, back pain, c-arm, fluoroscopic projections, disc space, lumbar discogram, fluoroscopic, needle,"

The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities.  The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives.  She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms.  Informed consent was obtained.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position.  Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace.  Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped.  A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia.  Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace.  On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery.  This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left.  A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1.  X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval.  Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed.  Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally.  The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected.  A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left.  It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion.  The nerve root was protected and medialized.  It was retracted with a nerve root retractor.  This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area.  A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy.  Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy.  Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace.  Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy.  Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces.  Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level.  Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina.  A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur.  Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension.  It was mobile within the neural foramina.  The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura.  Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin.  Compression dressing was applied.  The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits.  She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications.","surgery, lumbar laminotomy with discectomy, microscopic assisted, herniated nucleus pulposus, subcutaneous tissue, ligamentum flavum, kerrison rongeur, penfield elevator, lumbar laminotomy, lumbar fascia, nerve root, discectomy, lumbar, laminotomy, herniated,"

She is accompanied by her daughter.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient' daughter tells me that over the last month the patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional.  She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak.  She has not been having any headaches.  She has had a significant decrease in appetite.  She is known to have lung cancer, but Ms. Wilson does not know what kind.  According to her followup notes, it is presumed non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung.  The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008.  CT scan from 12/01/2009 shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, otherwise a normal head CT, no mass lesion.

She subsequently actually done reasonably well until about a month ago when she developed progressive severe intractable pain.  Imaging study showed that the distal hardware at the plate itself had fractured consistent with incomplete fusion across her osteomyelitis area.  There was no evidence of infection on the imaging or with her laboratory studies.  In addition, she developed a pretty profound stenosis at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that appeared to be recurrent as well.  She now presents for revision of her hardware, extension of fusion, and decompression.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  She was placed on the operative table in the prone position.  Back was prepared with Betadine, iodine, and alcohol.  We elliptically excised her old incision and extended this caudally so that we had access from the existing hardware fixation all the way down to her sacrum.  The locking nuts were removed from the screw post and both plates refractured or significantly weakened and had a crease in it.  After these were removed, it was obvious that the bottom screws were somewhat loosened in the pedicle zone so we actually tightened one up and that fit good snugly into the nail when we redirected so that it actually reamed up into the upper aspect of the vertebral body in much more secure purchase.  We then dressed the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels which were profoundly stenotic.  This was a combination of scar and overgrown bone.  She had previously undergone bilateral hemilaminectomies at L4-5 so we removed scar bone and actually cleaned and significantly decompressed the dura at both of these levels.  After completing this, we inserted the Capstone interbody spacer filled with morselized autograft bone and some BMP sponge into the disk space at both levels.  We used 10 x 32 mm spacers at both L4-L5 and L5-S1.  This corrected the deformity and helped to preserve the correction of the stenosis and then after we cannulated the pedicles of L4, L5 and S1 tightened the pedicle screws in L3.  This allowed us to actually seat a 20 cm plate contoured to the lumbar lordosis onto the pedicle screws all the way from S1 up to the T11 level.  Once we placed the plate onto the screws and locked them in position, we then packed the remaining BMP sponge and morselized autograft bone through the plate around the incomplete fracture healing at the L1 level and then dorsolaterally at L4-L5 and L5-S1 and L3-L4, again the goal being to create a dorsal fusion and enhance the interbody fusion as well.  The wound was then irrigated copiously with bacitracin solution and then we closed in layers using #1 Vicryl in muscle and fascia, 3-0 in subcutaneous tissue and approximated staples in the skin.  Prior to closing the skin, we confirmed correct sponge and needle count.  We placed a drain in the extrafascial space and then confirmed that there were no other foreign bodies.  The Cell Saver blood was recycled and she was given two units of packed red blood cells as well.  I was present for and performed the entire procedure myself or supervised.","surgery, degenerative spondylolisthesis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, lumbar re-exploration, internal fixation plate, hemilaminectomy, diskectomy, synthetic spacers, pedicle screws, fusion, lumbar, pedicle, fixation, hardware,"

The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity.  He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries.  Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on.  After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient.  ,PROCEDURE DETAIL:  ,He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03.  After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted.,The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table.  All of his bony prominences were well-padded.  At this time, a myelogram was then performed.  After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram.  The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region.  Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle.  At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac.  The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast.  The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left.  There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy.  At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy.  A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right.  The surgery was going to be on the left.  Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region.  At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia.  At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted.  Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina.  A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side.  At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction.  Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression.  Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots.  Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive.  We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root.  A nerve root retractor was then placed.  Identification of disc space was then performed.  A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade.  A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed.  The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc.  Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free.,At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur.  At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root.  We did not have any dural leaks during this case.  #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Sterile dressings were then applied.  The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.  At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level.","surgery, microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy, discectomy, nerve root, lumbar laminectomy, herniated nucleus, thecal sac, spinal needle, nucleus pulposus, disc space, root, nerve, weakness, lumbar, laminectomy, nucleus, pulposus, myelogram"
574, Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation., Surgery, Lumbar Puncture - 1 ,"PROCEDURE: , Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test.  She was transfused with packed red blood cells.  Her hemolysis seemed to slow down.  She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen.  Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital.  She had a blood culture, which was also negative.  She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously.  Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics.  After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.  Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.,Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.,DISPOSITION: , The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition.","surgery, moderate sedation, lumbar puncture, needle, lumbar, "

Lumbar laminectomy for decompression with foraminotomies L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 microtechniques.,2.  Repair of CSF fistula, microtechniques L5-S1, application of DuraSeal.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 82-year-old woman who has about a four-month history now of urinary incontinence and numbness in her legs and hands, and difficulty ambulating.  She was evaluated with an MRI scan, which showed a very high-grade stenosis in her lumbar spine, and subsequent evaluation included a myelogram, which demonstrated cervical stenosis at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 as well as a complete block of the contrast at L4-L5 and no contrast at L5-S1 either and stenosis at L3-L4 and all the way up, but worse at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  Yesterday, she underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-C5, C5-C6, C6-C7 and had some improvement of her symptoms and increased strength, even in the recovery room.  She was kept in the ICU because of her age and the need to bring her back to the operating room today for decompressive lumbar laminectomy.  The rationale for putting the surgery is close together that she is normally on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation, though she has been cardioverted.  She and her son understand the nature, indications, and risks of the surgery, and agreed to go ahead.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought from the Neuro ICU to the operating room, where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was rolled in a prone position on the Wilson frame.  The back was prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak, followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the usual anatomical landmarks, linear midline incision was made presumed over L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue, then Bovie electrocautery was used to isolate the spinous processes.  A Kocher clamp was placed in the anterior spinous ligament and this turned out to be L5-S1.  The incision was extended rostrally and deep Gelpi's were inserted to expose the spinous processes and lamina of L3, L4, L5, and S1.  Using the Leksell rongeur, the spinous processes of L4 and L5 were removed completely, and the caudal part of L3.  A high-speed drill was then used to thin the caudal lamina of L3, all of the lamina of L4 and of L5.  Then using various Kerrison punches, I proceeded to perform a laminectomy.  Removing the L5 lamina, there was a dural band attached to the ligamentum flavum and this caused about a 3-mm tear in the dura.  There was CSF leak.  The lamina removal was continued, ligamentum flavum was removed to expose all the dura.  Then using 4-0 Nurolon suture, a running-locking suture was used to close the approximate 3-mm long dural fistula.  There was no CSF leak with Valsalva.,I then continued the laminectomy removing all of the lamina of L5 and of L4, removing the ligamentum flavum between L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1.  Foraminotomies were accomplished bilaterally.  The caudal aspect of the lamina of L3 also was removed.  The dura came up quite nicely.  I explored out along the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots after completing the foraminotomies, the roots were quite free.  Further more, the thecal sac came up quite nicely.  In order to ensure no CSF leak, we would follow the patient out of the operating room.  The dural closure was covered with a small piece of fat.  This was all then covered with DuraSeal glue.  Gelfoam was placed on top of this, then the muscle was closed with interrupted 0 Ethibond.  The lumbodorsal fascia was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 0 Ethibond in a watertight fashion.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running 0 Vicryl, and finally the skin was closed with a running-locking 3-0 nylon.  The wound was blocked with 0.5% plain Marcaine.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Estimated blood loss for the case was about 100 mL.,SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS:  Correct.,FINDINGS:  A very tight high-grade stenosis at L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1.  There were adhesions between the dura and the ligamentum flavum owing to the severity and length of the stenosis.,The patient tolerated the procedure well with stable vitals throughout.","surgery, microtechniques, fistula, duraseal, foraminotomies, lumbar, stenosis, cerebrospinal, lumbar laminectomy, ligamentum flavum, csf, laminectomy, lamina,"

She has been dealing with these symptoms for greater than three months.  She comes to my office with severe pain, left my office and reported to the Emergency Room where she was admitted for pain control one day before surgery.  I have discussed the MRI findings with the patient and the potential risks and complications.  She was scheduled to go to surgery through my office, but because of her severe symptoms, she was unable to keep that appointment and reported right to the Emergency Room.  We discussed the diagnosis and the operative procedure in detail.  I have reviewed the potential risks and complications and she had agreed to proceed with the surgery.  Due to the patient's weight which exceeds 340 lb, there was some concern about her operative table being able to support her weight and also my standard microlumbar discectomy incision is not ________ in this situation just because of the enormous size of the patient's back and abdomen and I have discussed this with her.  She is aware that she will have a much larger incision than what is standard and has agreed to accept this.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital.  While in the hospital gurney, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic, endotracheal intubation was followed.  A Jackson table was prepared for the patient and was reinforced replacing struts under table to prevent the table from collapsing.  The table reportedly does have a limit of 500 lb, but the table has never been stressed above 275 lb.  Once the table was reinforced, the patient was carefully rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table with the bony prominences being well padded.  A marker was placed in from the back at this time and an x-ray was obtained for incision localization.  The back is now prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made over the L5-S1 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissue sharply with a #10 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The lumbar dorsal fascia was then encountered and incised to the left of midline.  In the subperiosteal fashion, the musculature was elevated off the lamina at L5 and S1 after facet joint, but not disturbing the capsule.  A second marker was now placed and an intraoperative x-ray confirms our location at the L5-S1 disc space.  The microscope was brought into the field at this point and the remainder of the procedure done with microscopic visualization and illumination.  A high speed drill was used to perform a laminotomy by removing small portion of the superior edge of the S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina.  Ligaments and fragments were encountered and removed at this time.  The epidural space was now encountered.  The S1 nerve root was now visualized and found to be displaced dorsally as a result of a large disc herniation while the nerve was carefully protected with a Penfield.  A small stab incision was made into the disc fragment and probably a large portion of disc extrudes from the opening.  This disc fragment was removed and the nerve root was much more supple, it was carefully retracted.  The nerve root was now retracted and using a series of downgoing curettes, additional disc material was removed from around the disc space and from behind the body of S1 and L5.  At this point, all disc fragments were removed from the epidural space.  Murphy ball was passed anterior to the thecal sac in the epidural space and there was no additional compression that I can identify.  The disc space was now encountered and loose disc fragments were removed from within the disc space.  The disc space was then irrigated.  The nerve root was then reassessed and found to be quite supple.  At this point, the Murphy ball was passed into the foramen of L5 and this was patent and also into the foramen of S1 by passing ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there were no obstructions in the passage of the device.  At this point, the wound was irrigated copiously and suctioned dry.  Gelfoam was used to cover the epidural space.  The retractors were removed at this point.  The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips for curved incision.  The patient was transferred to the hospital gurney in supine position and extubated by Anesthesia, subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.","surgery, extruded herniated disc, radiculopathy, microscopic, lumbar, discectomy, lumbar discectomy, morbid obesity, herniated disc, epidural space, nerve root, disc space, space, intractable, lamina, epidural, incision, nerve, herniated,"

The patient also requests sterilization.  Therefore, she requested a tubal ligation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.

Otherwise normal appearing uterus and bilateral tubes and ovaries.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthesia was obtained by Dr. X without difficulties.  The patient was placed in supine position with leftward tilt.  Fetal heart tones were checked and were 140s, and she was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  At this time, a Pfannenstiel skin incision made with a scalpel and carried down to the underlying fascia with electrocautery.  The fascia was nicked sharply in the midline.  The fascial incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kocher x2, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected sharply with the use of Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the superior aspect of the fascial incision.  Fascia was grasped, elevated, and rectus muscles dissected off sharply.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped, and entered sharply and the peritoneal incision extended inferiorly and superiorly with good visualization of bladder.  Bladder blade was inserted.  Vesicouterine peritoneum was tented up and a bladder flap was created using Metzenbaum scissors.  Bladder blade was reinserted to effectively protect the bladder from the operative field and the lower uterine segment incised in a transverse U-shaped fashion with the scalpel.  Uterine incision was extended laterally and manually.  Membranes were ruptured and bright yellow clear amniotic fluid was noted.  Infant's head was in a floating position, able to flex the head, push against the incision, and then easily brought it to the field vertex.  Nares and mouth were suctioned with bulb suction.  Remainder of the infant was delivered atraumatically.  The infant was very pale upon delivery.  Cord was doubly clamped and cut and immediately handed to the awaiting intensive care nursery team.  An 8 cm segment of the tube was doubly clamped and transected.  Cord gases were obtained.  Cord was then cleansed, laid on a clean laparotomy sponge, and cord blood was drawn for hematocrit measurements.  At this time, it was noted that the cord was significantly yellow stained as well as the placenta.  At this time, the placenta was delivered via gentle traction on the cord and exterior uterine massage.  Uterus was exteriorized and cleared off all clots and debris with dry laparotomy sponge and the lower uterine segment was closed with 1-0 chromic in a running locked fashion.  Two areas of oozing were noted and separate figure-of-eight sutures were placed to obtain hemostasis.  At this time, the uterine incision was hemostatic.  The bladder was examined and found to be well below the level of the incision repair.  Tubes and ovaries were examined and found to be normal.  The patient was again asked if she desires permanent sterilization of which she agrees and therefore the right fallopian tube was identified and followed out to the fimbriated end and grasped at the mid portion with a Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was divided with electrocautery and a 4-cm segment of tube was doubly tied and transected with a 3-cm segment of tube removed.  Hemostasis was noted.  Then, attention was turned to the left fallopian tube which in similar fashion was grasped and brought out through the fimbriated end and grasped the midline portion with Babcock clamp.  Mesosalpinx was incised and 3-4 cm tube doubly tied, transected, and excised and excellent hemostasis was noted.  Attention was returned to the uterine incision which is seemed to be hemostatic and uterus was returned to the abdomen.  Gutters were cleared off all clots and debris.  Lower uterine segments were again re-inspected and found to be hemostatic.  Sites of tubal sterilization were also visualized and were hemostatic.  At this time, the peritoneum was grasped with Kelly clamps x3 and closed with running 3-0 Vicryl suture.  Copious irrigation was used.  Rectus muscle belly was examined and found to be hemostatic and tacked and well approximated in the midline.  At this time, the fascia was closed using 0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Manual palpation confirms thorough and adequate closure of the fascial layer.  Copious irrigation was again used.  Hemostasis noted, and skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x3 and the patient was sent to the recovery room awake and stable condition.  Infant assumed the care of the intensive care nursery team and being followed and workup up for isoimmunization and fetal anemia.  The patient will be followed for her severe right upper quadrant pain post delivery.  If she continues to have pain, may need a surgical consult for gallbladder and/or angiogram for evaluation of right kidney and questionable venous plexus.  This all will be relayed to Dr. Y, her primary obstetrician who was on call starting this morning at 7 a.m. through the weekend.","surgery, intrauterine pregnancy, rh isoimmunization, primary low transverse cesarean section, bilateral tubal sterilization, pfannenstiel skin incision, fascial incision, uterine incision, fetal anemia, permanent sterilization, rectus muscles, incision, tubes, cord, "

Incision was made, Pfannenstiel, approximately 1.5 fingerbreadths above the symphysis pubis and carried sharply through subcutaneous and fascial layers without difficulty; the fascia being incised laterally.  Bleeders were bovied.  Rectus muscles were separated from the overlying fascia with blunt and sharp dissection.  Muscles were separated in the midline.  Peritoneum was entered sharply and incision was carried out laterally in each direction.  Bladder blade was placed and bladder flap developed with blunt and sharp dissection.  A horizontal _______ incision was made in the lower uterine segment and carried laterally in each direction.  Allis was placed in the incision, and an uncomplicated extraction of a 7 pound 4 ounce, Apgar 9 female was accomplished and given to the pediatric service in attendance.  Infant was carefully suctioned after delivery of the head and body.  Cord blood was collected.  _______ and endometrial cavity was wiped free of membranes and clots.  Lower segment incision was inspected.  There were some extensive adhesions on the left side and a figure-of-eight suture of 1 chromic was placed on both lateral cuff borders and the cuff was closed with two interlocking layers of 1 chromic.  Bleeding near the left cuff required an additional suture of 1 chromic after which hemostasis was present.  Cul-de-sac was suctioned free of blood and clots and irrigated.  Fundus was delivered back into the abdominal cavity and lateral gutters were suctioned free of blood and clots and irrigated.  Lower segment incision was again inspected and found to be hemostatic.  The abdominal wall was then closed in layers, 2-0 chromic on the peritoneum, 0 Maxon on the fascia, 3-0 plain on the subcutaneous and staples on the skin.  Hemostasis was present between all layers.  The area was gently irrigated across the peritoneum and fascial layers.  There were no intraoperative complications except blood loss.

The decision for C-section was made.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a supine position with a slight left lateral tilt and she was then prepped and draped in usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  The patient was then given general anesthesia and once this was completed, first knife was used to make a low transverse incision extending down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion with the use of curved Mayo scissors.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection was then completed both caudally and cephalically.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center and extended in a vertical fashion.  Peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  The bladder blade was put in place.  The bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum scissors and dissected away caudally.  The second knife was used to make a low transverse incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of the fetus.  The first fetus was vertex.  The fluid was clear.  The head was delivered followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician and nursery personnel.  The second fluid was ruptured.  It was the clear fluid as well.  The presenting part was brought down to be vertex.  The head was delivered followed by the rest of the body and the cord was doubly clamped and cut, and newborn handed off to waiting pediatrician in addition of the nursery personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained from both of the cords with careful identification of A and B. Once this was completed, the placenta was delivered and handed off for further inspection by Pathology.  At this time, it was noted at the uterus was adhered to the abdominal wall by approximately of 3 cm x 3 cm thick uterine adhesion and this was needed to be released by sharp dissection.  Then, there were multiple omental adhesions on the surface of the uterus itself.  This needed to be released as well as on the abdominal wall and then the uterus could be externalized.  The lining was wiped clean of any remaining blood and placental fragments and the edges of the uterus were grasped in four quadrants with Kocher and continuous locking stitch of 0 chromic was used to re-approximate the uterine incision, with the second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam underneath.  The right fallopian tube was grasped with a Babcock, it was doubly tied off with 0 chromic and the knuckle portion was then sharply incised and cauterized.  The same technique was completed on the left side with the knuckle portion cut off and cauterized as well.  The defect on the uterine surface was reinforced with 0 Vicryl in a baseball stitch to create adequate Hemostasis.  Interceed was placed over this area as well.  The abdominal cavity was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The edges of the peritoneum were grasped with hemostats and a continuous locking stitch was used to re-approximate abdominal rectus muscles as well as the peritoneal edges.  The abdominal rectus muscle was irrigated.  The corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl started on both corners and overlapped on the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the subcutaneous tissue.  Skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Uterus was evacuated of any remaining blood vaginally.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.","surgery, intrauterine pregnancy, gestation, preterm labor, omentum adhesions, low transverse c section, uterine adhesions, intrauterine, adhesions, abdominal, uterus, uterine, "

After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where spinal anesthetic with Astramorph was administered.  She was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was tested, it was found to be inadequate and a general anesthetic was administered.  Once the general anesthetic was administered and the patient was asleep, the previous incision was removed with the skin knife and this incision was then carried through an underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with a second knife.  This incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of this fascial incision was then dissected off to the underlying rectus muscle bluntly without using Ochsner clamps.  It was then dissected in the midline with Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was then addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were then separated in the midline with a hemostat.  The rectus muscles were separated further in the midline with Mayo scissors superiorly and inferiorly.  Next, the peritoneum was grasped with two hemostats, tented up and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors, being careful to avoid the bladder and the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, the bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tenting up with Allis clamps and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally in both directions and a bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted.  Next, the uterine incision was made with a second knife and the uterus was entered with the blunt end of the knife.  Next, the uterine incision was extended laterally in both directions with the banded scissors.  Next, the infant's head and body were delivered without difficulty.  There was multiple section on the abdomen.  The cord was clamped and cut.  Section of cord was collected for gases and the cord blood was collected.  Next, the placenta was manually extracted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The edges of the uterine incision were then identified with Allis _______ clamps.  The uterine incision was reapproximated with #0 chromic in a running locked fashion and a second layer of the same suture was used to obtain excellent hemostasis.  One figure-of-eight with #0 chromic was used in one area to prevent a questionable hematoma from expanding along the varicosity for the anterior fibroid.  After several minutes of observation, the hematoma was seem to be non-expanding.  The uterus was replaced in the abdomen.  The uterine incision was reexamined and seem to be continuing to be hemostatic.  The pelvic gutters were then cleared of all clots and debris.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The peritoneum was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The rectus muscles reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a single interrupted stitch.  The fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running locked fashion and the skin was closed with staples.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x3.  The patient was then taken to Recovery in stable condition and she will be followed for immediate postoperative course in the hospital.",

The patient's uterus is intact, bladder is intact.,HISTORY: , The patient is an approximately 25-year-old Caucasian female with gravida-4, para-1-0-2-1.  The patient's last menstrual period was in December of 2002 with a foreseeable due date on 09/16/03 confirmed by ultrasound.,The patient has a history of herpes simplex virus to which there is no active prodromal and no evidence of lesions.  The patient has a history of IVDA and contracted hepatitis C with slightly elevated liver transaminases.  The patient had been seen through our office for prenatal care.  The patient is on Valtrex.  The patient was found to be 3 cm about 40%, 0 to 9 engaged.  Bag of waters was ruptured.  She was on Pitocin.  She was contracting appropriately for a couple of hours or so with appropriate ________.  There was no cervical change noted.  Most probably because there was a sink vertex and that the head was too large to descend into the pelvis.  The patient was advised of this and we recommended cesarean section.  She agreed.  We discussed the surgery, foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment, the procedure itself, and recovery in layman's terms.  The patient's questions were answered.  I personally made sure that she understood every aspect of the consent and that she was comfortable with the understanding of what would transpire.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was then taken back to operative suite.  She was given anesthetic and sterilely prepped and draped.  Pfannenstiel incision was used.  A second knife was used to carry the incision down to the anterior rectus fascia.  Anterior rectus fascia was incised in the midline and carried bilaterally and the fascia was lifted off the underlying musculature.  The rectus muscles were separated.  The patient's peritoneum tented up towards the umbilicus and we entered the abdominal cavity.  There was a very thin lower uterine segment.  There seemed to be quite a large baby.  The patient had a small nick in the uterus.  Following the blunt end of the bladder knife going through the innermost layer of the myometrium and into the endometrial cavity, clear amniotic fluid was obtained.  A blunt low transverse cervical incision was made.  Following this, we placed a ________ on the very large fetal head.  The head was delivered following which we were able to deliver a large baby girl, 9 lb, good at tone and cry.  The patient then underwent removal of the placenta after the cord blood and ABG were taken.  The patient's uterus was examined.  There appeared to be no retained products.  The patient's uterine incision was reapproximated and sutured with #0 Vicryl in a running non-interlocking fashion, the second imbricating over the first.  The patient's uterus was hemostatic.  Bladder flap was reapproximated with #0 Vicryl.  The patient then underwent an irrigation at every level of closure and the patient was quite hemostatic.  We reapproximated the rectus musculature with care being taken not to incorporate any underlying structures.  The patient had three interrupted sutures of this.  The fascia was reapproximated with two stitches of #0 Vicryl going from each apex towards the midline.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  There was noted no fascial defects and the skin was closed with #0 Vicryl.,Prior to closing the abdominal cavity, the uterus appeared to be intact and bladder appeared to have clear urine and appeared to be intact.  The patient was hemostatic.  All counts were correct and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

A viable male neonate with Apgars of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively.  Infant weight equaled to 4140 gm with clear amniotic fluid.  The umbilical cord was wrapped around the leg tightly x1.  Infant was in a vertex, right occiput anterior position.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 19-year-old G1 P0 at 41 and 1/7th weeks' intrauterine pregnancy.  She presented at mid night on 08/22/03 complaining of spontaneous rupture of membranes, which was confirmed in Labor and Delivery.  The patient had a positive group beta strep colonization culture and was started on penicillin.  The patient was also started on Pitocin protocol at that time.  The patient was monitored throughout the morning showing some irregular contractions every 5 to 6 minutes and then eventually no contractions on the monitor.  IUPC was placed without difficulty and contractions appeared to be regular, however, they were inadequate amount of the daily units.  The patient was given a rest from the Pitocin.  She walked and had a short shower.  The patient was then placed back on Pitocin with IUPC in place and we were unable to achieve adequate contractions.  Maximum cervical dilation was 5 cm, 80% effaced, negative 2 station, and cephalic position.  At the time of C-section, the patient had been ruptured for over 24 hours and it was determined that she would not progress in her cervical dilation, as there was suspected macrosomia on ultrasound.  Options were discussed with the patient and family and it was determined that we will take her for C-section today.  Consent was signed.  All questions were answered with Dr. X present.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where a spinal anesthetic was placed.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with left upward tilt.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and her spinal anesthetic was found to adequate.  A Pfannenstiel incision was made with a first scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second scalpel.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using curved Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Ochsner and Kocher clamps and elevated off the rectus muscles.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the incision where Kocher clamps were used to elevate the fascia off the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in the midline bluntly.  The underlying peritoneum was tented up with Allis clamps and incised using Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneum was then bluntly stretched.  The bladder blade was placed.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, tented up with Allis' and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted in the lower uterine segment.  A low transverse uterine incision was made with a second scalpel.  The uterine incision was extended laterally bluntly.  The bladder blade was removed and the infant's head was delivered with the assistance of a vacuum.  Infant's nose and mouth were bulb suctioned and the body was delivered atraumatically.  There was, of note, an umbilical cord around the leg tightly x1.,Cord was clamped and cut.  Infant was handed to the waiting pediatrician.  Cord gas was sent for pH as well as blood typing.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was grasped circumferentially with Alfred clamps and closed with #0-Chromic in a running locked fashion.  A second layer of imbricating stitch was performed using #0-Chromic suture to obtain excellent hemostasis.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The rectus muscle was loosely approximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a single interrupted fashion.  The fascia was reapproximated with #0-Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous Scarpa's fascia was then closed with #2-0 plain gut.  The skin was then closed with staples.  The incision was dressed with sterile dressing and bandage.  Blood clots were evacuated from the vagina.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

The patient had oligohydramnios and also when placed on the monitor had nonreassuring fetal heart rate with late deceleration.  Due to the IUGR as well a decision for a C-section was made.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a seated position with standard spinal form of anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The patient was then repositioned, prepped and draped in a slight left lateral tilt.  Once this was completed first knife was used to make a low transverse skin incision approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in transverse fashion.  Edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher and both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was completed consistent with the Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the center, extended in vertical fashion and the peritoneum was entered at a high point and extended in vertical fashion.  Bladder blade was put in place and a bladder flap was created with the use of Metzenbaum and pickups and then bluntly dissected via cautery and reincorporated in the bladder blade.  Second knife was used to make a low transverse uterine incision with care being taken to avoid the presenting part of fetus.  Presenting part was vertex, the head was delivered, followed by the remaining portion of the body.  The mouth and nose were suctioned through bulb syringe and the cord was doubly clamped and cut and then the newborn handed off to waiting nursing personnel.  Cord pH blood and cord blood was obtained.  The placenta was delivered manually and the uterus was externalized and the lining was cleaned off any remaining placental fragments and blood and the incisional edges were reapproximated with 0-chromic and a continuous locking stitch with a second layer used to imbricate the first.  The bladder flap was re-peritonized with Gelfoam underneath and abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the uterus was placed back in its anatomical position.  The gutters were wiped clean of any remaining blood and fluid and the edges of the perineum grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitches of 2-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the abdominal rectus muscle as well as the perineum.  This area was then irrigated.  Cautery was used for adequate hemostasis, corners of the fascia grasped with hemostats and continuous locking stitch of 1-Vicryl was started at both corners and overlapped in the center.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Skin edges reapproximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The uterus was evacuated of any remaining clots vaginally.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct.","surgery, apgars, low transverse c section, fetal heart rate, bladder blade, intrauterine pregnancy, intrauterine"

The patient began having prodromal symptoms 2 to 3 days prior to presentation.  She was seen on 03/09/2007 and a nonstress test was performed.  This revealed some spontaneous variable-appearing decelerations.  She was given IV hydration.  A biophysical profile was obtained, which provided a score of 0/8 with only a 1 cm fluid pocket found.  Therefore, she was admitted for further fetal monitoring and evaluation.  She had changed her cervix from closed 2 days prior to presentation to 1 cm dilated.  She was having somewhat irregular contractions, but with stronger contractions, continued to have decelerations to 50 to 60 beats per minute.  Due to these findings, a scalp electrode was placed as well as an IUPC for an amnioinfusion.  This relieved the decelerations somewhat.  However, over a period of time with strong contractions, she still had bradycardia 40 to 50 beats per minute and developed a late component on the return of the decelerations.  Due to this finding, it was evident that the fetal state would not support labor in order to accomplish a vaginal delivery.  These findings were reviewed with the patient and recommendation was made for cesarean section delivery.  The risks and benefits of this surgery were reviewed, and knowing these facts, the patient gave informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where her epidural anesthesia was reinforced.  She was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for the procedure.  After adequate epidural level was confirmed, the scalp was utilized to make a transverse incision in the patient's lower abdominal wall.  This incision was carried down to the level of the fascia, which was also transversely incised.  After adequate hemostasis, the fascia was bluntly and sharply separated up from the underlying rectus muscle.  The rectus muscle was separated in midline exposing the peritoneum.  The peritoneum was carefully grasped and elevated with hemostats.  It was entered in an up and down fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The bladder blade was placed in the lower pole of the incision to protect the bladder.,The uterus was palpated and inspected.  A thin lower uterine segment was noted.  The vertex presentation was confirmed.  The scalp was then utilized to make a transverse or Kerr incision in the lower uterine wall.  Clear fluid was noted upon entering into the amniotic space.  At 05:27, a term viable female infant was delivered up through the incision.  She had spontaneous respirations.  She was given bulb suctioning for clear fluid.  Her cord was clamped and cut and she was delivered off the field to Dr. X who was attending.  The baby girl was subsequently signed Apgars of 8 at one minute and 9 at five minutes.  Her birth weight was found to be 5 pounds and 5 ounces.,The placenta was manually extracted from the endometrial cavity.  A ring clamp and two Allis clamps were placed around the margin of the uterine incision for hemostasis.  The uterus was delivered up into the operative field.  The endometrial cavity was swiped clean with a moist laparotomy pad.  The uterine incision was then closed in a two-layered fashion with 0 Vicryl suture, the first layer interlocking and the second layer imbricating.  Two additional stitches of 3-0 Vicryl suture were utilized for hemostasis.  The uterine incision was noted to be hemostatic upon closure.  The uterus was rotated forward, normal tubes and ovaries were noted on both sides.  The uterus was then returned to its normal position of the abdominal cavity.  The sponge and instrument count was performed for the first time at this point and found to be correct.  The pelvis and anterior uterine space was then irrigated with saline solution.  It was suctioned dry.  A final check of the uterine incision confirmed hemostasis.  The rectus muscle was stabilized across the midline with two simple stitches of 0 Vicryl suture.  The subcutaneous tissue was then exposed, and the fascia closed with two running lengths of 0 Vicryl suture, beginning in lateral margins and overlapping the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was then irrigated and inspected.  No active bleeding was noted.  It was closed with a running length of 3-0 plain catgut suture.  The skin was then approximated with surgical steel staples.  The incision was infiltrated with a 0.5% solution of Marcaine local anesthetic.  The incision was cleansed and sterilely dressed.,The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  The estimated blood loss through the procedure was 450 mL.  The sponge and instrument counts were performed two more times during closure and found to be correct each time.","surgery, low-transverse incision, edc, para, amnioinfusion, nonreassuring fetal heart tracing, primary cesarean section, fetal heart tracing, low transverse, term pregnancy, fetal heart, heart tracing, rectus muscle, uterine incision, vicryl suture, incision, transverse, fetal, suture, uterine, "

The uterus appeared to be intact.  This patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian female.  The patient is well known to the OB/GYN clinic.  The patient had two previous C-sections.  She appears to be in probably early labor.  She had an amniocentesis early today.  She is contracting regularly about every three minutes.  The contractions are painful and getting much more so since the amniocentesis.  The patient had fetal lung maturity noted.  The patient also has probable IUGR as none of her babies have been over 4 lb.  The patient's baby appears to be somewhat small.  The patient suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which has left her wheelchair bound.  The patient has had a spinal fusion, however, family planning is definitely complete per the patient.  The patient refuses trial labor.  The patient and I discussed the consent.  She understands the foreseeable risks and complications, alternative treatment of the procedure itself, and recovery.  Her questions were answered.  The patient also understands that when we occlude her tube that she is at risk for failure of this part of the procedure, which would result in either an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy.  The patient understands this and would like to try our best.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  She was given general anesthetic by Department of Anesthesiology.  Once again, in layman's terms, the patient understands the risks.  The patient had the informed consent reviewed and understood.  The patient has had a Pfannenstiel incision, which was slightly bent towards the right side favoring the right side.  The patient had the first knife went through this incision.  The second knife was used to go to the level of fascia.  The fascia was very thin, ruddy in appearance, and with abundant scar tissue.  The fascia was incised.  Following this, we were able to see the peritoneum.  There was really no obvious rectus abdominal muscles noted.  They were very weak, atrophic, and thin.  The patient has the peritoneum tented up.  We entered the abdominal cavity.  The bladder flap was then entered into the anterior abdominal wall and to the underlying area of the fascia.  The bladder flap was then entered into the uterus as well.  There are some bladder adhesions.  We removed these adhesions and we removed the bladder of the fascia.  We dissected the bladder of the lower segment.  We made a small nick on the lower segment.  We were able to utilize the blunt end of the knife to enter into the uterine cavity.  The baby was in occiput transverse position with the ear being cocked at such a position as well.  The patient's baby was delivered without difficulty.  It was a 4 lb and 10 oz baby girl who vigorously cried well.  There was a prolapse of the umbilical cord just below the chin as well and this may be attributed to the decelerations we caught on the monitor strip right before we decided to have her undergo resection.  The patient's placenta was delivered.  There was no retained placenta.  The uterine incision was closed with two layers of #0 Vicryl, the second layer imbricating over the first.  The patient on the right side had the inferior epigastric artery and the vein just underneath the peritoneum easily visualized.  Then we ligated this as there was bleeding and oozing.  The patient had the Indigo Carmine instilled into the bladder with some saline about 300 cc.  The 400 cc was instilled.  The bladder appears to be intact.  The bladder did require extensive dissection of the fascia in order to be able to get a proper fascial edges for closure and dissection of the lower uterine segment.  There was some oozing around the area of the bladder.  We placed an Avitene there.  The two Hulka clips were placed perpendicular to going across each fallopian tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient has two clips on each side.  There was excellent tubal occlusion and placement.  The uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity.  We rechecked again.  The tubal placement was excellent.  It did not involve the round ligaments, uterosacral ligaments, the uteroovarian ligaments, and the tube into the mesosalpinx.  The patient then underwent further examination.  Hemostasis appeared to be good.  The fascia was reapproximated with short running intervals of #0 Vicryl across the fascia.  We took care not to get into any bleeders and to make sure that the fascia was indeed closed as best as it was possible.  The Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #0 gut.  The skin was reapproximated then as well via subcutaneous closure.  The patient's sponge and needle counts found to be correct.  Uterus appeared to be normal prior to closure.  Bladder appeared to be normal.  The patient's blood loss is 600 cc.","surgery, intrauterine growth rate, charcot-marie-tooth disease, amniocentesis, c-sections, trial labor, low transverse cervical cesarean section, lysis of adhesions, dissection, bladder, abdominal wall, fascia, hulka clips, bilateral tubal occlusion, intrauterine, transverse, uterus, abdominal, "

The patient progressed to 8 cm, at which time, Pitocin was started.  She subsequently progressed to 9 cm, but despite adequate contractions, arrested dilation at 9 cm.  A decision was made to proceed with a primary low transverse cesarean section.,The procedure was described to the patient in detail including possible risks of bleeding, infection, injury to surrounding organs, and possible need for further surgery.  Informed consent was obtained prior to proceeding with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where epidural anesthesia was found to be adequate.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position with a left-ward tilt.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried through to the underlying layer of fascia using the Bovie.  The fascia was incised in the midline and extended laterally using Mayo scissors.  Kocher clamps were used to elevate the superior aspect of the fascial incision, which was elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of the fascial incision, which in similar fashion was grasped with Kocher clamps, elevated, and the underlying rectus muscles were dissected off bluntly and using Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscles were dissected in the midline.,The peritoneum was bluntly dissected, entered, and extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted.  The vesicouterine peritoneum was identified with pickups and entered sharply using Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap was created digitally.  The bladder blade was reinserted.  The lower uterine segment was incised in a transverse fashion using the scalpel and extended using manual traction.  Clear fluid was noted.  The infant was subsequently delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were bulb suctioned.  The cord was clamped and cut.  The infant was subsequently handed to the awaiting nursery nurse.  Next, cord blood was obtained per the patient's request for cord blood donation, which took several minutes to perform.  Subsequent to the collection of this blood, the placenta was removed spontaneously intact with a 3-vessel cord noted.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was repaired in 2 layers using 0 chromic suture.  Hemostasis was visualized.  The uterus was returned to the abdomen.,The pelvis was copiously irrigated.  The uterine incision was reexamined and was noted to be hemostatic.  The rectus muscles were reapproximated in the midline using 3-0 Vicryl.

The adhesion was taken down, and the entire pleural surface along the edge of the adhesion was sent for pathologic analysis.  The final frozen pathology on this entire area returned as negative for tumor.  Additional chest wall abnormalities were biopsied and sent for pathologic analysis, and these all returned separately as negative for tumor and only fibrotic tissue.  Several other biopsies were taken and sent for permanent analysis of the chest wall.  All of the biopsy sites were additionally marked with Hemoclips.  The right middle lobe lesion was accompanied with distal pneumonitis and otherwise no direct involvement of the right upper lobe or right lower lobe.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 100 mL.,CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY: , Stable.,HISTORY OF PROCEDURE:,  This patient is well known to our service.  He was admitted the night before surgery and given hemodialysis and had close blood sugar monitoring in control.  The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on April 4, 2007, was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident.  Although, he had markedly difficult airway, the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi.  No abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree, and based on this, the decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  The patient was kept in the supine position, and the single-lumen endotracheal tube was removed and a double-lumen tube was placed.  Following this, the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded.  Sterile DuraPrep preparation on the right chest was placed.  A sterile drape around that was also placed.  The table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces.  A second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision.  The incisions for the VATS right middle lobectomy included a small 1-cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula.  The camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5-mm 30-degree scope was used.  Third incision was an anterior port, which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space, and the third incision was a utility port, which was a 4 cm long incision, which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein.  All of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure.  The initial incision was the camera port through which, under direct visualization, an additional small 5-mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port.  These two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions, which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions.  Multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken, and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port.  Through these three incisions, the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed.  Multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative.  The right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall.  This area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis.  This also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue, but no tumor cells.  Based on this, the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.  Following this, the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed.  The middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45-mm EndoGIA stapler.  Following division of the right superior pulmonary vein, the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified.  Initially, this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus, but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45-mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the pulmonary artery was easily identified.  Two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe.  These were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp.  The vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk, and following this, an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe.  A fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus.  This was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm EndoGIA.  Following division of this, the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe.  Following complete division of the fissure, the lobe was put into an EndoGIA bag and taken out through the utility port.  Following removal of the right middle lobe, a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4R area as well as the 7 lymph node package.  Node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified, therefore none were taken.  The patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted.  A 19-French Blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32-French chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position.  Following this, the patient's lung was allowed to reexpand fully, and the patient was checked for air leaking once again.  Following this, all the ports were closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue, and 3-0 Vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, middle lobe, endogia, fiberoptic, mediastinal lymph node, vats, bronchoscopy, chest tube, chest wall, endotracheal tube, endotracheally, lobectomy, lung cancer, pneumonitis, sampling, thoracostomy, utility port, lumen endotracheal tube, superior pulmonary vein, chest wall lesions, anterior chest wall, middle lobectomy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, anterior chest, lymph node, node, port, chest, bronchus, tumor, pulmonary, incision,"

Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After an adequate general anesthesia was given, she was placed in the left lateral decubitus and the right chest was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Lateral thoracotomy was performed on the right side anterior to the tip of the scapula, and this was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue.  The latissimus dorsi muscle was partially transected and then the serratus was reflected anteriorly.  The chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space.  A retractor was placed and then extensive number of adhesions between the lung and the pleura were lysed carefully with sharp and blunt dissection.  The right lower lobe was identified.  There was a large mass in the superior segment of the lobe, which was very close to the right upper lobe, and because of the adhesions, it could not be told if the tumor was extending into the right upper lobe, but it appeared that it did not.  Dissection was then performed at the lower lobe of the fissure, and a GIA stapler was placed through here to separate the tumor from the upper lobe including a small segment of the upper lobe with the lower lobe.  Then, dissection of the hilum was performed, and the branches of the pulmonary artery to the lower lobe were ligated with #2-0 silk freehand ties proximally and distally and #3-0 silk transfixion stitches and then transected.  The inferior pulmonary vein was dissected after dividing the ligament, and it was stapled proximally and distally with a TA30 stapler and then transected.  Further dissection of the fissure allowed for its completion with a GIA stapler and then the bronchus was identified and dissected.  The bronchus was stapled with a TA30 bronchial stapler and then transected, and the specimen was removed and sent to the Pathology Department for frozen section diagnosis.  The frozen section diagnosis was that of non-small cell carcinoma, bronchial margins free and pleural margins free.  The mediastinum was then explored.  No nodes were identified around the pulmonary ligament or around the esophagus.  Subcarinal nodes were dissected, and hemostasis was obtained with clips.  The space below and above the osseous was opened, and the station R4 nodes were dissected.  Hemostasis was obtained with clips and with electrocautery.  All nodal tissue were sent to Pathology as permanent specimen.  Following this, the chest was thoroughly irrigated and aspirated.  Careful hemostasis was obtained and a couple of air leaks were controlled with #6-0 Prolene sutures.  Then, two #28 French chest tubes were placed in the chest, one posteriorly and one anteriorly, and secured to the skin with #2-0 nylon stitches.  The incision was then closed with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl pericostal stitches.  A running #1 PDS on the muscle layer, a running 2-0 PDS in the subcutaneous tissue, and staples on the skin.

The patient was placed in the supine position under spinal anesthesia with a Foley catheter in place and she was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A low abdominal transverse skin incision was constructed and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue through the anterior rectus fascia.  Bleeding points were snapped and coagulated along the way.  The fascia was opened transversally and was dissected sharply and bluntly from the underlying rectus muscles.  These were divided in the midline revealing the peritoneum, which was opened vertically.  The uterus was in mid position.  The bladder flap was incised elliptically and reflected caudad.  A low transverse hysterotomy incision was then constructed and extended bluntly.  Amniotomy revealed clear amniotic fluid.  A live born vigorous male infant was then delivered from the right occiput transverse position.  The infant breathed and cried spontaneously.  The nares and pharynx were suctioned.  The umbilical cord was clamped and divided and the infant was passed to the waiting neonatal team.  Cord blood samples were obtained.  The placenta was manually removed and the uterus was eventrated for closure.  The edges of the uterine incision were grasped with Pennington clamps and closure was carried out in standard two-layer technique using 0 Vicryl suture with the second layer imbricating the first.  Hemostasis was completed with an additional figure-of-eight suture of 0 Vicryl.  The cornual sac and gutters were irrigated.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  The adnexa were inspected and were normal.  The abdomen was then closed in layers.  Fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with running 3-0 plain Catgut, and skin with 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture and Steri-Strips.

Mediastinal lymph node dissection.,ANESTHESIA,1.  General endotracheal anesthesia with dual-lumen tube.,2.  Thoracic epidural.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room, and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered with a dual-lumen tube.  Next, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, and his right chest was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make an incision in the skin approximately 1 fingerbreadth below the angle of the scapula.  Dissection was carried down in a muscle-sparing fashion using Bovie electrocautery.  The 5th rib was counted, and the 6th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We identified the major fissure.  We then began by freeing up the inferior pulmonary ligament, which was done with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, we used Bovie electrocautery to dissect the pleura off the lung.  The pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung were identified.  Of note was the fact that there was a visible, approximately 4 x 4-cm mass in the right upper lobe of the lung without any other metastatic disease palpable.  As mentioned, a combination of Bovie electrocautery and sharp dissection was used to identify the pulmonary artery branches to the right upper lobe of the lung.  Next, we began by ligating the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This was done with suture ligature in combination with clips.  After taking the pulmonary artery branches of the right upper lobe of the lung, we used a combination of blunt dissection and sharp dissection with Metzenbaum scissors to separate out the pulmonary vein branch of the right upper lobe of the lung.  This likewise was ligated with a 0 silk.  It was stick-tied with a 2-0 silk.  It was then divided.  Next we dissected out the bronchial branch to the right upper lobe of the lung.  A curved Glover was placed around the bronchus.  Next a TA-30 stapler was fired across the bronchus.  The bronchus was divided with a #10-blade scalpel.  The specimen was handed off.  We next performed a mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Clips were applied to the base of the feeding vessels to the lymph nodes.  We inspected for any signs of bleeding.  There was minimal bleeding.  We placed a #32-French anterior chest tube, and a #32-French posterior chest tube.  The rib space was closed with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  A flat Jackson-Pratt drain, #10 in size, was placed in the subcutaneous flap.  The muscle layer was closed with a combination of 2-0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl, followed by 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.

She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.

The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle.  There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone.  There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus.  There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.  The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact.  Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability.,HISTORY: , This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August.  She was diagnosed per MRI.  An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear.  She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations.  She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint.  All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder.  She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle.  The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction.  They were taken on the back table.  The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons.  The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures.  The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table.  Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee.  The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a probe was placed.  Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified.  It was resected using a meniscal resector.  It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver.  Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment.  A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver.  The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable.  A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon.  There was noted to be excellent fixation.  The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch.  First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint.  Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.  Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal.  A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament.  This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill.  Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position.  A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm.  Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur.  A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur.  It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide.  The tendon was then placed around the wire.  The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel.  A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons.  Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel.  The knee was cycled approximately 20 times.  A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft.  There was noted definite fixation of the graft.  There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension.  The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry.  A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint.  Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision.  Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture.  The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer.  The tourniquet was deflated.  It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.  She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension.  She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal.  She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity.",

Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.","surgery, arthroplasty, ligament, tendon, fcr, tendon interposition arthroplasty, ligament reconstruction, reconstruction, trapezium, metacarpal, joint, interposition,"

Discussed risks, complications, and consequences of a surgical biopsy of the left true vocal cord and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operative suite by anesthesia, placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the operative table was turned 90 degrees by the Department of Anesthesia.  A shoulder roll was then placed followed by the patient being placed in reverse Trendelenburg.,After this, a mouthguard was placed in the upper teeth and a Dedo laryngoscope was placed in the patient's oral cavity and advanced through the oral cavity in the oropharynx down into the hypopharynx.  The patient's larynx was then brought into view with the true vocal cords hidden underneath what appeared to be redundant false vocal cords.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed and appeared to have an extensive area of leukoplakia extending from the posterior one-third up to the anterior third.  The false vocal cord also appeared to be very full on the left side along with fullness in the subglottic region.  The patient's anterior commissure appeared to be clear.  The false cord on the right side also appeared to be very redundant and overshadowing the true vocal cord.  Once the true vocal cord was retracted laterally, there was revealed a second area of leukoplakia involving the right true vocal cord in the anterior one-third aspect.  The patient's subglottic region was very edematous and with redundant mucosal tissue.  The areas of leukoplakia appeared to be cobblestoned in appearance, irregularly bordered, and very hard to the touch.  The left true vocal cord was then first addressed, was stripped from posteriorly to anteriorly utilizing a #45 laryngeal forceps.  After this, the patient had pressure placed upon this area with tropical adrenaline and a rectal swab to maintain hemostasis.  The specimen was passed off the field and was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  Hemostasis was maintained on the left side.  Prior to taking this biopsy, the Louie arm was attached to the laryngoscope and then suspended on the Mayo stand.  The Zeiss operating microscope was then brought into view to directly visualize the vocal cords.  The biopsies were taken under direct visualization utilizing the Zeiss operating microscope.  After the specimen was taken and the laryngoscope was desuspended from the Mayo stand and Louie arm was removed, the scope was then pulled more cephalad and the piriform sinuses, valecula, and base of the tongue were all directly visualized, which appeared normal except for the left base of tongue appeared to be full.

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.

Using the LEEP tenaculum, we were able to grasp the anterior lip of the cervix with a large wire loop at 35 cutting, 30 coagulation.  The endocervical polyp on the posterior lip of the cervix was excised.,Then changing from a 50 of coagulation and 5 cutting, the base of the polyp was electrocoagulated, which controlled all the bleeding.  The wire loop was attached, and the pigmented raised nevus on the inner thigh was excised with the wire loop.  Cautery of the base was done, and then it was closed with figure-of-eight 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  A band-aid was applied over this.,Rechecking the cervix, no bleeding was noted.  The patient was laid flat on the table, awakened, and moved to the recovery room bed and sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, endocervical polyp, pigmented mole, polyp, leep tenaculum, leep, cervix, endocervical, pigmented "

Subsequently, biopsy confirmed tumor persistence in the right glottic region.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgical intervention versus possibility of chemoradiation therapy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Also concerned for a CT scan finding of possible cartilaginous invasion at the cricoid level.  The patient understood the issues regarding surgical intervention and wished to undergo a surgical intervention despite a clear understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives.  He was accompanied by his wife and daughter.  Risks included, but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury of the nerves including lower lip weakness, tongue weakness, tongue numbness, shoulder weakness, need for physical therapy, possibility of total laryngectomy, possibility of inability to speak or swallow, difficulty eating, wound care issues, failure to heal, need for additional treatment, and the patient understood all of these issues and they wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx.,PROCEDURE DETAIL: , After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table.  After the establishment of the general anesthesia via oral endotracheal intubation, the patient had his eyes protected with Tegaderm.  A #6 endotracheal tube was placed initially.  Direct laryngoscopy was performed with a Lindholm laryngoscope.  A 0-degree endoscope was used to take pictures of what was apparently a recurrence of tumor along the right true vocal fold extending into the anterior arytenoid area and extending about 1 cm below into the subglottis.  Subsequently, a decision was then made to go ahead and perform the surgical intervention.  A hemi-apron incision was employed, and 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected.  A shoulder roll was applied after the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, a hemi-apron incision was performed.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised at the hyoid bone into the clavicle.  Attention was then turned to the right side, where a level 2, 3, 4 neck dissection was performed.  Submandibular fascia was appreciated inferiorly along the submandibular gland, this was incised allowing for identification of the digastric muscle.  Digastric tunnel was performed posteriorly to the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The fascia along the sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected along the anterior aspect until the cranial nerve XI was identified.  Level 2A contents were then dissected off the floor of the neck including levels 3 and 4.  Preservation of the phrenic nerve was obtained by identification, and subsequently cross-clamping fibrofatty tissue and lymph nodes just adjacent to the jugular vein inferiorly at level 4.  The specimen was then mobilized over the internal jugular vein with preservation of hypoglossal nerve.  Levels 2, 3, 4 neck dissection specimens were then labeled appropriately, attached with staples, and sent for histopathological evaluation.,Attention was then turned to attempting to perform a partial laryngectomy up front with a possibility of total laryngectomy as discussed.  Subsequently, the strap muscles were separated in the midline.  The trachea was identified in the midline.  The thyroid isthmus was plicated using the Harmonic scalpel, and attention was then turned to transecting the strap muscles at the superior aspect of the thyroid cartilage.  Once this was performed, sinuses were mobilized from the thyroid cartilage both on the right and left side respectively.  The cricothyroid joint was then freed on the left side and then on the right side with noting on the right side that this cartilage was a bit more irregular.  Attention was then turned to performing a cricothyrotomy.  Upon performing this, it was obvious that there was tumor just above the level of the cricothyrotomy incision.  A #7 anode tube was then placed in this area and secured.  Attention was then turned to performing the laryngotomy at the level of the petiole of epiglottis.  Subsequently, the cuts were made on the left side with visualization of the vocalis process and coming down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the thyroid cartilage was then intentionally fractured along the anterior spine.  It was evident that this tumor had extended more than 1 cm into the subglottic region.  Careful dissection of larynx from an inferior margin and portion of cricoid cartilage resection then was performed posteriorly, though it was evident that the cricoid cartilage was invaded.  Frozen section biopsy then confirmed this finding as read by Dr. X of Surgical Pathology.,In light of this finding with cartilaginous invasion and inability to preserve the cricoid cartilage, the patient's case was then converted into a total laryngectomy.  Subsequently, the trachea was transected at the level 3, 4 tracheal ring into cartilaginous space and anterior tracheal stoma was fashioned using 3-0 vertical mattress sutures for the skin.  A W-plasty was also performed to allow for enlargement of the stoma.  Attention was then turned to identifying the common parting wall of the trachea and the esophagus.  Attention was then turned to resecting the hyoid bone.  The remainder of the specimen cuts were made superior from sinus preserving a modest amount of pharyngeal mechanism.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Subsequently, a tracheoesophageal puncture site was performed using a right-angled hemostat at about approximately 1 cm from the posterior tracheal wall superior aspect.  Once this was performed, a running 3-0 canal stitch was used to close the pharynx.  Subsequently, interrupted 4-0 chromic stitches were then used as reinforcement line from superior to inferior, and fibrin glue was applied.  Two #10 JP drains were placed on the right side and one on the left side and secured appropriately with 3-0 nylon.  The wound was then closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the platysma and staples for the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought to the Weinberg Intensive Care Unit with the endotracheal tube still in place to be decannulated later.","surgery, laryngectomy, neck dissection, tracheoesophageal, cricopharyngeal myotomy, thyroid lobectomy, squamous cell carcinoma, larynx, thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total laryngectomy, thyroid, cartilage"

She does complain of some frequent urination.  Her vaginal bleeding is minimal.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap.  There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall.  The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.  The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey.  All instruments were removed.  The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed.

The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.  He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.  However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain.  The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram.  Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.  The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia.  The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.  The patient has a rather long torso.  Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.  Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.  An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area.  Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver.  Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation.  The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick.  After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy.  The trocars were removed.,A right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.  A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.  The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.  Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it.  Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.  The duodenum was kocherized.  The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.  Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem.  The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.,It was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was.  Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short.  Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.  This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.  At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration.  The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.  After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct.  So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed.  Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously.  No further stones were obtained.  The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater.  At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.  However, a stone was found distally still floating around.  This was removed with stone forceps.  The bile ducts were irrigated again.  No further stones were removed.  A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.  A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area.  Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area.  I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct.  The bile duct lumen was widely open.  T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.  The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.,The remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site.  The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision.  Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers.  Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control.  The umbilical incision was closed with 0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures for the fascia, 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues, and staples for the skin.

Both ovaries and tubes appeared within normal limits.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where she was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion in the dorsal supine position.  After the general anesthetic was found to be adequate, a Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the first knife.  This was carried through the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline with the second knife and the fascial incision was then extended laterally in both directions with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and dissected off the underlying layer of rectus muscle bluntly.  It was then dissected in the middle with the Mayo scissors.  The inferior aspect of this incision was addressed in a similar manner.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline bluntly.  The peritoneum was identified with hemostat clamps, tented up, and entered sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with the Metzenbaum scissors and then extended bluntly.  Next, the uterus was grasped bluntly and removed from the abdomen.  The fundal fibroid was identified.  It was then injected with vasopressin, 20 units mixed in 30 cc of normal saline along the serosal surface and careful to aspirate to avoid any blood vessels.  15 cc was injected.  Next, the point tip was used with the cautery _______ cutting to cut the linear incision along the top of the _______ fibroid until fibroid fibers were seen.  The edges of the myometrium was grasped with Allis clamps, tented up, and a hemostat was used to bluntly dissect around the fibroid followed by blunt dissection with a finger.  The fibroid was easily and bluntly dissected out.  It was also grasped with Lahey clamp to prevent traction.  Once the blunt dissection of the large fibroid was complete, it was handed off to the scrub nurse.  The large fibroid traversed the whole myometrium down to the mucosal surface and the endometrial cavity was largely entered when this fibroid was removed.  At this point, several smaller fibroids were noticed along the endometrial surface of the uterus.  Three of these were removed just by bluntly grasping with the Lahey clamp and twisting, all three of these were approximately 1 cm to 2 cm in size.  These were also handed to the scrub tech.  Next, the uterine incision was then closed with first two interrupted layers of #0 chromic in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion and then with a #0 Vicryl in a running baseball stitch.  The uterus was seen to be completely hemostatic after closure.  Next, a 3 x 4 inch piece of Interceed was placed over the incision and dampened with normal saline.  The uterus was then carefully returned to the abdomen and being careful not to disturb the Interceed.  Next, the greater omentum was replaced over the uterus.,The rectus muscles were then reapproximated with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl in the midline.  Then the fascia was closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Next, the Scarpa's fascia was closed with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The incision was then dressed with 0.5-inch Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately.

She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for pelviolabdominal surgery.  Bimanual examination revealed a mid position normal-sized uterus with benign adnexal area.,In the high lithotomy position, a weighted speculum was placed into the posterior vaginal wall.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum.  A Hulka tenaculum was placed transcervically.  The other instruments were removed.  A Foley catheter was placed transurethrally to drain the bladder intraoperatively.,In the low lithotomy position and in steep Trendelenburg, attention was turned to the infraumbilical region.  Here, a stab wound incision was made through which the 120 mm Veress needle was placed and approximately 3 L of carbon dioxide used to create a pneumoperitoneum.  The needle was removed, the incision minimally enlarged, and the #5 trocar and cannula were placed.  The trocar was removed and the scope placed confirming a preperitoneal insufflation.,The space was drained off the insufflated gas and 2 more attempts were made, which failed due to the patient's adiposity.  Attention was turned back to the vaginal area where in the high lithotomy position, attempts were made at a posterior vaginal apical insertion.  The Hulka tenaculum was removed, the posterior lip of the cervix grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum, and the long Allis clamp used to grasp the posterior fornix on which was placed traction.  The first short and subsequently 15 cm Veress needles were attempted to be placed, but after several passes, no good pneumoperitoneum could be established via this route also.  It was elected not to do a transcervical intentional uterine perforation, but to return to the umbilical area.  The 15 cm Veress needle was inserted several times, but again a pneumo was preperitoneal.,Finally, an open laparoscopic approach was undertaken.  The skin incision was expanded with a knife blade.  Blunt dissection was used to carry the dissection down to the fascia.  This was grasped with Kocher clamps, entered sharply and opened transversely.  Four 0 Vicryl sutures were placed as stay sutures and tagged with hemostats and needles were cutoff.  Dissection continued between the rectus muscle and finally the anterior peritoneum was reached, grasped, elevated, and entered.,At this juncture, the Hasson cannula was placed and tied snugly with the above stay sutures while the pneumoperitoneum was being created, a #10 scope was placed confirming the intraperitoneal positioning.,Under direct visualization, a suprapubic 5 mm cannula and manipulative probe were placed.  Clockwise inspection of the pelvis revealed a benign vesicouterine pouch, normal uterus and fundus, normal right tube and ovary.  In the cul-de-sac, there were 3 clusters of 3 to 5 carbon charred type endometrial implants and those more distally in the greatest depth had created puckering and tenting.  The left tube and ovary were normal.  There were no adhesions.  There was no evidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.,The Endoshears and subsequently cautery on a hook were placed and the implants fulgurated.  Pictures were taken for confirmation both before and after the burn.,The carbon chars were irrigated and aspirated.  The smoke plume was removed without difficulty.  Approximately 50 mL of irrigant was left in the pelvis.  Due to the difficulty in placing and maintaining the Hasson cannula, no attempts were made to view the upper abdominal quadrant, specifically the liver and gallbladder.,The suprapubic cannula was removed under direct visualization, the pneumo released, the scope removed, the stay sutures cut, and the Hasson cannula removed.  The residual sutures were then tied together to completely occlude the fascial opening so that there will be no future hernia at this site.  Finally, the skin incisions were approximated with 3-0 Dexon subcuticularly.  They had been preincisionally injected with bupivacaine to which the patient said she had no known allergies.  The vaginal instruments were removed.  All counts were correct.

Normal-appearing adnexa bilaterally.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administration of general anesthesia the patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Uterine manipulator was inserted as well as a Foley catheter and this was then draped off from the remainder of the abdominal field.  A 5 mm incision was made umbilically after injecting 0.25% Marcaine; 0.25% Marcaine was injected in all the incisional sites.  Veress needle was inserted, position confirmed using the saline drop method.  After confirming an opening pressure of 4 mmHg of CO2 gas, approximately four liters was insufflated in the abdominal cavity.  Veress needle was removed and a 5 mm port placed and position confirmed using the laparoscope.  A 5 mm port was placed three fingerbreadths suprapubically and on the left and right side.  All these were placed under direct visualization.  Pelvic cavity was examined with findings as noted above.  The left utero-ovarian ligament was grasped and cauterized using the Gyrus.  Part of the superior aspect of the broad ligament was then cauterized as well.  Following this the anterior peritoneum over the bladder flap was incised and the bladder flap bluntly resected off the lower uterine segment.  The remainder of the broad and cardinal ligament was then cauterized and excised.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  The cardinal ligament was resected all the way down to 1 cm above the uterosacral ligament.  After assuring that the bladder was well out of the way of the operative field, bipolar cautery was used to incise the cervix at a level just above the uterosacral ligaments.  The area was irrigated extensively and cautery used to assure hemostasis.  A 15 mm probe was then placed on the right side and the uterine morcellator was used to remove the specimen and submitted to pathology for examination.  Hemostasis was again confirmed under low pressure.  Using Carter-Thomason the fascia was closed in the 15 mm port site with 0 Vicryl suture.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,Exploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.

Laparoscopically, the patient has large omental to anterior abdominal wall adhesions along the left side of the abdomen extending down to the left adnexa.  There are adhesions involving the right ovary to the anterior abdominal wall and the bowel.  There are also adhesions from the omentum to the anterior abdominal wall near the liver.  The uterus and ovaries appear within normal limits other than the adhesions.  The left fallopian tube grossly appeared within normal limits.  The right fallopian tube was not well visualized but appeared grossly scarred and no tubal end was visualized.  There was a large area of endometriosis, approximately 1 cm wide in the left ovarian fossa and there was a small spot of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was also vesicular appearing endometriosis lesion in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken in the operating room and generalized anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  After exam under anesthetic, weighted speculum was placed in the vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded and then was serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size 10 Hank, then the uterine manipulator was inserted and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum was removed along with the weighted speculum and attention was turned towards the abdomen.  An approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus with the skin knife.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp.  The abdomen was tented up and a Veress needle inserted through this incision.  When the Veress needle was felt to be in place, deep position was checked by placing saline in the needle.  This was seen to freely drop in the abdomen so it was connected to CO2 gas.  Again, this was started at the lowest setting, was seen to flow freely, so it was advanced to the high setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  Next, the laparoscope was inserted through this port.  The medial port was connected to CO2 gas.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately 2 fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis.  Through this, a Veress needle was inserted followed by size #5 step trocar and this procedure was repeated under direct visualization on the right upper quadrant lateral to the umbilicus and a size #5 trocar was also placed.  Next, a grasper was placed through the suprapubic port.  This was used to grasp the bowel that was adhesed to the right ovary and the Harmonic scalpel was then used to lyse these adhesions.  Bowel was carefully examined afterwards and no injuries or bleeding were seen.  Next, the adhesions touching the right ovary and anterior abdominal wall were lysed with the Harmonic scalpel and this was done without difficulty.  There was a small amount of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall peritoneum.  This was ablated with the Harmonic scalpel.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to lyse and ablate the endometriosis in the left ovarian fossa and the posterior cul-de-sac.  Both of these areas were seen to be hemostatic.  Next, a grasper was placed and was used to bluntly remove the vesicular lesion from the posterior cul-de-sac.  This was sent to pathology.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated with the Nezhat dorsi suction irrigator and the irrigator was removed.  It was seen to be completely hemostatic.  Next, the two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The size #11 introducer was replaced and the #11 port was removed.,Next, all the ports were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were dressed with Steri-Strips and bandaged appropriately and the patient was taken to recovery in stable condition and she will be discharged home today with Darvocet for pain and she will follow-up in one week in the clinic for pathology results and to have a postoperative check.","surgery, pelvic pain, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, laparoscopy, scalpel ablation, lysis of adhesions, cervical dilation, peritoneal biopsy, harmonic scalpel, adhesions, harmonic, scalpel, abdominal, pelvic, abdomen, anterior, "

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","surgery, laparoscopic right orchiopexy, undescended testes, orchiopexy, bilateral undescended testes, mosquito clamps, subdartos pouch, internal ring, laparoscopic,"

She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.

No ascites was present.  On assessment of the upper abdomen, the stomach, diaphragm, liver, gallbladder, spleen, omentum, and peritoneal surfaces of the bowel, were all unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought into the operating room with an intravenous line in placed, and anesthetic was administered.  She was placed in a low anterior lithotomy position using Allen stirrups.  The vaginal portion of the procedure included placement of a ZUMI uterine manipulator with a Koh colpotomy ring and a vaginal occluder balloon.,The laparoscopic port sites were anesthetized with intradermal injection of 0.25% Marcaine.  There were five ports placed, including a 3-mm left subcostal port, a 10-mm umbilical port, a 10-mm suprapubic port, and 5-mm right and left lower quadrant ports.  The Veress needle was placed through a small incision at the base of the umbilicus, and a pneumoperitoneum was insufflated without difficulty.  The 3-mm port was then placed in the left subcostal position without difficulty, and a 3-mm scope was placed.  There were no adhesions underlying the previous vertical midline scar.  The 10-mm port was placed in the umbilicus, and the laparoscope was inserted.  Remaining ports were placed under direct laparoscopic guidance.  Washings were obtained from the pelvis, and the abdomen was explored with the laparoscope, with findings as noted.,Attention was then turned to lymphadenectomy.  An incision in the retroperitoneum was made over the right common iliac artery, extending up the aorta to the retroperitoneal duodenum.  The lymph node bundle was elevated from the aorta and the anterior vena cava until the retroperitoneal duodenum had been reached.  Pedicles were sealed and divided with bipolar cutting forceps.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  Boundaries of dissection included the ureters laterally, common ileac arteries at uterine crossover inferiorly, and the retroperitoneal duodenum superiorly with careful preservation of the inferior mesenteric artery.  Right and left pelvic retroperitoneal spaces were then opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament with the bipolar cutting forceps.  The retroperitoneal space was then opened and the lymph nodes were dissected, with boundaries of dissection being the bifurcation of the common iliac artery superiorly, psoas muscle laterally, inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior boundary was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  The left common iliac lymph node was elevated and removed using the same technique.,Attention was then turned to the laparoscopic hysterectomy.  The right infundibulopelvic ligament was divided using the bipolar cutting forceps.  The mesovarium was skeletonized.  A bladder flap was mobilized by dividing the round ligaments using the bipolar cutting forceps, and the peritoneum on the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.  Once the Koh colpotomy ring was skeletonized and in position, the uterine arteries were sealed using the bipolar forceps at the level of the colpotomy ring.  The vagina was transected using a monopolar hook (or bipolar spatula), resulting in separation of the uterus and attached tubes and ovaries.  The uterus, tubes, and ovaries were then delivered through the vagina, and the pneumo-occluder balloon was reinserted to maintain pneumoperitoneum.  The vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches of 0-Vicryl using the Endo-Stitch device.  The abdomen was irrigated, and excellent hemostasis was noted.,The insufflation pressure was reduced, and no evidence of bleeding was seen.  The suprapubic port was then removed, and the fascia was closed with a Carter-Thomason device and 0-Vicryl suture.  The remaining ports were removed under direct laparoscopic guidance, and the pneumoperitoneum was released.  The umbilical port was removed using laparoscopic guidance.

A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.  We placed the patient on IV antibiotics and pain medications.  We will obtain KUB and x-rays for stent placement.

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.","surgery, gastric bypass, eea anastomosis, roux-en-y, antegastric, antecolic, morbid obesity, roux limb, gastric pouch, intubation, laparoscopic, bypass, roux, endotracheal, anastomosis, gastric"

The patient's baseline creatinine was around 1.6 to 1.7.  The patient was found to have a 3 to 4-cm exophytic right renal mass, 1-cm renal mass inferior to that, and about 2-cm left renal mass.  Since the patient had bilateral renal disease and the patient had renal insufficiency, the best option at this time had been cryoprocedure for the kidney versus partial nephrectomy, one kidney at a time.  The patient understood all his options, had done some research on cryotherapy and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient had a renal biopsy done, which showed a possibility of an oncocytoma, which also would indicate that if this is not truly a cancerous lesion, but there is an associated risk of renal cell carcinoma that the patient will benefit from a cryo of the kidney.,Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, bowel obstruction, ileus, injury to bowel, postoperative bleeding, etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of delayed bleeding, the needing for nephrectomy, renal failure, renal insufficiency, etc., and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OR:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was bowel prepped.  The patient was placed in right side up, left side down, semiflank, with kidney rest up.  All the pressure points are very well padded using foam and towels.  The left knee was bent and the right knee was straight.  There was no tension on any of the joints.  All pressure points were well padded.  The patient was taped to the table using 2-inch wide tape all the way around.  A Foley catheter and OG tube were in place prior to prepping and draping the patient.  A periumbilical incision measuring about 6 cm was made.  The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia using sharp dissection.  The peritoneum was open.  Abdomen was entered.  There were some adhesions on the right side of the abdomen, which were released using metz.  Two 12-mm ports were placed in the anteroaxillary line and one in the midclavicular line.  A gel porter was placed.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained.  All ports were placed under direct vision, and the right colon was reflected medially.  Duodenum was cauterized.  Minimal dissection was done on the hilum and the Gerota's was opened laterally, and the renal masses were clearly visualized all the way around.  Pictures were taken.  Superficial biopsies were taken of 2 renal lesions using 3 different probes.  The 2 lesions were frozen.  The 2 probes were 2.4 mm and the other one was 3.1 mm in diameter.  So the R3.8 and R2.4 long probes were used.  Freezing/thawing, two cycles were done.  The temperatures were -131, -137, -150 and the freezing time was 5 and 10 minutes each and passive sign was done.  The exact times or exact temperatures are on the chart.  There was a nice ice ball with each freezing and with passive sign.  The probes were removed.,The probes were placed directly percutaneously through the skin into the renal lesions.,After freezing/thawing, the probes were removed and to seal with Surgicel were placed.  Pictures were taken after following total of 20 minutes were spent looking at the renal mass to make sure that there was no delayed bleeding.  From the time the probes were removed, until the time the laparoscope was removed, was total of 30 minutes.  So the masses were visualized for a total of 30 minutes without any pneumoperitoneum.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained again.  Fibrin glue was placed over it just for precautionary measure.  There was about a total of 100 mL of blood loss overall with the entire procedure.  Please note that towels were used to prep off the colon and the liver to ensure there was no freezing of any other organ.  The kidney was kept in the left hand at all times.  Careful attention was drawn to make sure that the probe was deep enough, at least 3.5 to 4 cm in, to get the medial aspect of the tumors frozen.  The laparoscopic vacuum ultrasound showed that there was complete resolution of these lesions.  At the end of the procedure, after freezing/thawing and putting the fibrin glue, Surgicel, and EndoSeal, the colon was reflected medially.  Please note that the perirenal fat was placed over the lesion to ensure that the frozen area of the kidney was not exposed to the bowel.  Lap count was correct.  Please note that renal biopsy for permanent section was performed on the superficial aspect of the lesions.  No deeper biopsies were done to minimize the risk of bleeding.  The 12-mm ports were closed using 0-Vicryl and the middle incision.  The hand-port incision was closed using looped #1 PDS from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Please note that the pneumoperitoneum was closed using 0-Vicryl in running fashion.  After closing the abdomen, 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin and Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.","surgery, hand-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation, laparoscopic, cryoablation, bilateral renal mass, fibrin glue, laparoscopic cryoablation, renal insufficiency, renal lesions, renal biopsy, renal mass, insufficiency, renal, freezing/thawing, lesions"

The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stones were visualized.  Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This was also taken and sent off as specimen.  The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  The abdomen was de-insufflated.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.  All incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures.  The areas were cleaned and dried.  Steri-Strips were placed.  On the incisions, sterile dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following procedure.  She is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with Dr. X within one week for a follow-up evaluation.","surgery, excision of liver cyst, gallbladder, omentum, cystic artery, gallstone, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cystic duct, liver cyst, liver, abdomen, electrocautery, cholelithiasis, cholecystectomy, adhesions, laparoscopic, cyst, cystic, "

She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.,The infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.

A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, acute cholecystitis, cholangiogram, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, gallbladder, gangrenous cholecystitis, bovie cautery, cystic duct, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cystic, duct,"

The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.,A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted.  Saline test was performed.  Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg.  The Veress needle was removed.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted.  Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it.  It was largely mobile.  The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity.  A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line.  A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.,The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction.  The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal.  Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed.  The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot.  The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided.  This was done while the common duct was in full visualization.  The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided.  The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.,The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution.  There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula.  The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear.  Hemostasis was excellent.  CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed.  The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.

There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was slightly larger.  There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder.  The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small.  With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct.  Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.,PROCEDURE:,  Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully.  Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.,After limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.

An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.

Sponge, needle, and instrument counts were correct per OR staff.,HISTORY:,  This is a 57-year-old female who was found to have a large left adrenal mass, approximately 5.5 cm in size.  She had undergone workup previously with my associate, Dr. X as well as by Endocrinology, and showed this to be a nonfunctioning mass.  Due to the size, the patient was advised to undergo an adrenalectomy and she chose the laparoscopic approach due to her multiple pulmonary comorbidities.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Showed multiple intraabdominal adhesions in the anterior abdominal wall.  The spleen and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was surgically absent.,There was large amount of omentum and bowel in the pelvis, therefore the gynecological organs were not visualized.  There was no evidence of peritoneal studding or masses.  The stomach was well decompressed as well as the bladder.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, she was taken to the operating room and given general anesthesia.  She was placed on a bean bag and secured to the table.  The table was rotated to the right to allow gravity to aid in our retraction of the bowel.,Prep was performed.  Sterile drapes were applied.  Using the Hassan technique, we placed a primary laparoscopy port approximately 3 cm lateral to the umbilicus on the left.  Laparoscopy was performed with ___________.  At this point, we had a second trocar, which was 10 mm to 11 mm port.  Using the non-cutting trocar in the anterior axillary line and using Harmonic scalpel, we did massive lysis of adhesions from the anterior abdominal wall from the length of the prior abdominal incision, the entire length of the abdominal incision from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus.  The adhesions were taken down off the entire anterior abdominal wall.,At this point, secondary and tertiary ports were placed.  We had one near the midline in the subcostal region and to the left midline and one at the midclavicular line, which were also 10 and 11 ports using a non-cutting blade.,At this point, using the Harmonic scalpel, we opened the white line of Toldt on the left and reflected the colon medially, off the anterior aspect of the Gerota's fascia.  Blunt and sharp dissection was used to isolate the upper pole of the kidney, taking down some adhesions from the spleen.  The colon was further mobilized medially again using gravity to aid in our retraction.  After isolating the upper pole of the kidney using blunt and sharp dissection as well as the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to dissect the plane between the upper pole of the kidney and lower aspect of the adrenal gland.  We were able to isolate the adrenal vein, dumping into the renal vein, this was doubly clipped and transected.  There was also noted to be vascular structure of the upper pole, which was also doubly clipped and transected.  Using the Harmonic scalpel, we were able to continue free the remainder of the adrenal glands from its attachments medially, posteriorly, cephalad, and laterally.,At this point, using the EndoCatch bag, we removed the adrenal gland through the primary port in the periumbilical region and sent the flap for analysis.  Repeat laparoscopy showed no additional findings.  The bowel was unremarkable, no evidence of bowel injury, no evidence of any bleeding from the operative site.,The operative site was irrigated copiously with saline and reinspected and again there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated and was reinspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding.,At this point, the camera was switched to one of the subcostal ports and the primary port in the periumbilical region was closed under direct vision using #0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, each of the other ports were removed and then with palpation of each of these ports, this indicated that the non-cutting ports did close and there was no evidence of fascial defects.,At this point, the procedure was terminated.  The abdominal cavity was desufflated as stated.  The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition.  Postoperative orders were written.  The procedure was discussed with the patient's family at length.",

The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was intubated.  Foley catheter was in place.  The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped.  A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel.  The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala.  Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone.  The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting.  The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints.  Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed.  Pars interarticularis were maintained.  Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise.  Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side.  Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe.  It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body.  At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed.  Good bone purchase was obtained.  Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1.  Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots.  Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation.  Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision.  Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was stapled.  The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system.  The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.

He had previous lumbar laminectomy at L4-L5.  He was noted to have an isthmic spondylolisthesis.,Previous lumbar laminectomy exacerbated this condition and made it further unstable.  He is suffering from neurogenic claudication.  He was unresponsive to extensive conservative treatment.  He has understanding of the risks, benefits, potential complications, treatment alternatives and provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #5 where he was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia.  He was subsequently placed prone on the Jackson's spinal table with all bony prominences well padded.  His lumbar spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A previous midline incision was extended from approximate level of L3 to S1.  This was in the midline.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided sharply.  Electrocautery provided hemostasis.  ,Electrocautery was utilized to dissect through subcutaneous tissue of lumbar fascia.  The lumbar fascia was identified and split in the midline.  Subperiosteal dissection was then carried out with electrocautery and ______ elevated from the suspected levels of L3-S1.  Once this was exposed, the transverse processes, a Kocher clamp was placed and a localizing cross-table x-ray confirmed the interspace between the spinous processes of L3-L4.  Once this was completed, a self-retaining retractor was then placed.  With palpation of the spinous processes, the L4 posterior elements were noted to be significantly loosened and unstable.  These were readily mobile with digital palpation.  A rongeur was then utilized to resect the spinous processes from the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  This bone was morcellized and placed on the back table for utilization for bone grafting.  The rongeur was also utilized to thin the laminas from the inferior half of L3 to superior half of S1.  Once this was undertaken, the unstable posterior elements of L4 were meticulously dissected free until wide decompression was obtained.  Additional decompression was extended from the level of the inferior half of L3 to the superior half of S1.  The microscope was utilized during this portion of procedure for visualization.  There was noted to be no changes during the decompression portion or throughout the remainder of the surgical procedure.  Once decompression was deemed satisfactory, the nerve roots were individually inspected and due to the unstable spondylolisthesis, there was noted to be tension on the L4 and L5 nerve roots crossing the disc space at L4-L5.  Once this was identified, foraminotomies were created to allow additional mobility.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry.  Working type screws, provisional titanium screws were then placed at L4-l5.  This was to allow distraction and reduction of the spondylolisthesis.  These were placed in the pedicles of L4 and L5 under direct intensification.  The position of the screws were visualized, both AP and lateral images.  They were deemed satisfactory.,Once this was completed, a provisional plate was applied to the screws and distraction applied across L4-L5.  This allowed for additional decompression of the L5 and L4 nerve roots.  Once this was completed, the L5 nerve root was traced and deemed satisfactory exiting neural foramen after additional dissection and discectomy were performed.  Utilizing a series of interbody spacers, a size 8 mm spacer was placed within the L4-L5 interval.  This was taken in sequence up to a 13 mm space.  This was then reduced to a 11 mm as it was much more anatomic in nature.  Once this was completed, the spacers were then placed on the left side and distraction obtained.  Once the distraction was obtained to 11 mm, the interbody shavers were utilized to decorticate the interbody portion of L4 and L5 bilaterally.  Once this was taken to 11 mm bilaterally, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  A 11 mm height x 9 mm width x 25 mm length carbon fiber cages were packed with local bone graft and Allograft.  There were impacted at the interspace of L4-L5 under direct image intensification.  Once these were deemed satisfactory, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The provisional screws and plates were removed.  This allowed for additional compression along L4-L5 with the cage instrumentation.  Permanent screws were then placed at L4, L5, and S1 bilaterally.  This was performed under direct image intensification.  The position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, the posterolateral gutters were decorticated with an AM2 Midas Rex burr down to bleeding subchondral bone.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The morcellized Allograft and local bone graft were mixed and packed copiously from the transverse processes of L4-S1 bilaterally.  A 0.25 inch titanium rod was contoured of appropriate length to span from L4-S1.  Appropriate cross connecters were applied and the construct was placed over the pedicle screws.  They were tightened and sequenced to allow additional posterior reduction of the L4 vertebra.  Once this was completed, final images in the image intensification unit were reviewed and were deemed satisfactory.  All connections were tightened and retightened in Torque 2 specifications.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suction dried.  The dura was inspected and noted to be free of tension.  At the conclusion of the procedure, there was noted to be no changes on the SSEP, EMG, and neurophysiologic monitors.  An 8-inch Hemovac drain was placed exiting the wound.  The lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl in interrupted fashion, the subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, surgical stainless steel clips were used to approximate the skin.  The remainder of the Hemovac was assembled.  Bulky compression dressing utilizing Adaptic, 4x4, and ABDs was then affixed to the lumbar spine with Microfoam tape.  He was turned and taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded.",

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.,I met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.,There was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.","surgery, adhesions, peritoneum, purulent debris, umbilical fascia, peritoneal cavity, laparoscopic appendectomy, appendectomy, constipation, purulent, debris, umbilical, appendix, abdomen, laparoscopic, perforation, appendicitis,"

Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6.  There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7.  The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid.  X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid.,The patient had been on pain medication.  The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments.  He was given the option of surgical intervention.  We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression.  I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery.  If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion.  The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking.  I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft.  I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life.  Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely.,The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire.  The wire would be left permanently.,Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve.  His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist.  He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure.  Other procedures may be necessary later.  There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function.  He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life.  He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes.  He could get difficulty swallowing or eating.  He could have substantial weakness in the arm.  He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting.,He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery.,He stated he understood all the risks.  He did not wish to get any other treatments.  He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia.,I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls.  His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder.  The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes.  The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped.  Care was taken to position both arms and both legs.  Pulses were checked.,A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine.  A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure.  Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4.  A lateral view was done after an instrument in place.  This revealed the C6-C7 level.  I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5.  I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level.,I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor.,Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5.  I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left.  I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4.  This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots.  There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used.  Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal.  There was no retraction.  I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found.,At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent.  The nerve roots had been fully decompressed.,I then checked stability.  There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level.  I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion.,I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5.  I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4.  Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5.  I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage.  I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5.,Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped.  An incision made over the iliac crest.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest.  I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone.,I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5.  Drill holes made with a clip.  I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process.  I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire.,Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5.  I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5.,The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex.  Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed.,No drain was placed in the hip.,A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine.  The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition.",

Fluoroscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,HISTORY:  ,The patient had a lumbar subarachnoid drain placed yesterday.  All went well with the surgery.  The catheter stopped draining and on pulling back the catheter, it fractured and CT scan showed that the remaining fragment is deep to the lamina.  The patient continues to have right eye blindness and headaches, presumably from the pseudotumor cerebri.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed prone on the operating room table resting on chest rolls.  Her face was resting in a pink foam headrest.  Extreme care was taken positioning her because she weighs 92 kg.  There was a lot of extra padding for her limbs and her limbs were positioned comfortably.  The arms were not hyperextended.  Great care was taken with positioning of the head and making sure there was no pressure on her eyes especially since she already has visual disturbance.  A Foley catheter was in place.  She received IV Cipro 400 mg because she is allergic to most antibiotics.,Fluoroscopy was used to locate the lower end of the fractured catheter and the skin was marked.  It was also marked where we would try to insert the new catheter at the L4 or L3 interspinous space.,The patient was then prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A 7-cm incision was made over the L1 lamina.  The incision was carried down through the fascia all the way down to the spinous processes.  A self-retaining McCullough retractor was placed.  The laminae were quite deep.  The microscope was brought in and using the Midas Rex drill with the AM-8 bit and removing some of the spinous process of L1-L2 with double-action rongeurs, the laminotomy was then done using the drill and great care was taken and using a 2-mm rongeur, the last layer of lamina was removed exposing the epidural fat and dura.  The opening in the bone was 1.5 x 1.5 cm.,Occasionally, bipolar cautery was used for bleeding of epidural veins, but this cautery was kept to a minimum.,Under high magnification, the dura was opened with an 11 blade and microscissors.  At first, there was a linear incision vertically to the left of midline, and I then needed to make a horizontal incision more towards the right.  The upper aspect of the cauda equina was visualized and perhaps the lower end of the conus.  Microdissection under high magnification did not expose the catheter.  The fluoroscope was brought in 2 more times including getting a lateral view and the fluoroscope appeared to show that the catheter should be in this location.,I persisted with intensive microdissection and finally we could see the catheter deep to the nerves and I was able to pull it out with the microforceps.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,At this point, I then attempted lumbar puncture by making a small incision with an 11 blade in the L4 interspinous space and then later in the L3 interspinous space and attempted to puncture the dural sac with the Tuohy needle.  Dr. Y also tried.  Despite using the fluoroscope and our best attempts, we were not able to convincingly puncture the lumbar subarachnoid space and so the attempted placement of the new lumbar catheter had to be abandoned.  It will be done at a later date.,I felt it was unsafe to place a new catheter at this existing laminotomy site because it was very high up near the conus.  The potential for complications involving her spinal cord was greater and we have already had a complication of the catheter now and I just did not think it was safe to put in this location.,Under high magnification, the dura was closed with #6-0 PDS interrupted sutures.,After the dura was closed, a piece of Gelfoam was placed over the dura.  The paraspinous muscles were closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  The subcutaneous fascia was also closed with 0 Vicryl interrupted suture.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and the skin with #4-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The 4-0 Vicryl Rapide sutures were also used at the lumbar puncture sites to close the skin.,The patient was then turned carefully on to her bed after sterile dressings were applied and then taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts correct.  Blood loss minimal, none replaced.  This procedure took 5 hours.  This case was also extremely difficult due to patient's size and the difficulty of locating the catheter deep to the cauda equina.","surgery, laminotomy, microdissection, lumbar spinal catheter, external lumbar drain, fluoroscopy, lumbar subarachnoid, spinal catheter, intracranial hypertension, vicryl interrupted sutures, lumbar, catheter, "

She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae.  She was in extreme pain.  This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives.  The patient provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table.  She was given sedative.  The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae.  Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed.,Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side.  This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left.  Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well.  Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally.  Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously.  Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion.  Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae.  The Jamshidi needles were then removed.  A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae.  This bone was then removed and sent to the lab.  The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle.  This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion.  Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted.  The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed.  An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7.  In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well.  A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images.  The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body.  Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae.  The balloons were inserted bilaterally.  The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg.  These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture.  Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed.  The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas.  This was done directly under image intensification.  Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra.  The cement was allowed to cure.  The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained.  The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation.  The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion.  Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape.  She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.  She was moving all four extremities without deficit.  She had no significant pain.","surgery, pathologic insufficiency, vertebrae, fracture, fracture reduction, vertebroplasties, kyphoplasty, prosthetic device, jamshidi needles, insertion, prosthetic,"

He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound.  He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair.  For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines.  He has fullness in the back of his wound.  The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak.  The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics.  The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level.  Full-thickness skin flaps were developed.  It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid.  Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal.  Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements.  It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1.  It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis.  Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately.  Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left.  Complete laminectomy at L3 was done.  Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen.  Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made.  There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation.  The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl.  After this the standard starting point was made.  Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall.  The screws were subsequently placed.  Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws.  Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1.  This was done on the right side first.  The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5.  Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4.  Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side.  Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately.  Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5.,Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette.  Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix.  This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters.  DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately.  Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound.  Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1.  Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately.  Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape.  The drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition.  No complications arose.",

She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007.  The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only.  The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises.  She was also given a brace.  The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment.  It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy.  Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered.  Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed.  Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling.  All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Esmarch was then removed.  Incisions were then made.  Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line.  Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation.  The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies.  There was a small plica.  Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia.  Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability.  ACL was noted to be intact.  The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology.  Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica.  The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles.  The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed.  The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%.  At the end of the case, all instruments were removed.  The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine.  Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case.  The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s.  The kneecap was translated medially under pressure and a bias placed.  The tourniquet was released at 47 minutes.  The patient was then placed in the knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will weightbear as tolerated in the knee immobilizer.  She will start physical therapy within 1 to 2 weeks to work on patella mobilization as well as reconditioning and strengthening.  Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother.

The patient was then transferred to the operating room table in supine position with Johnson knee holder well-padded.  Tourniquet was placed around the left upper thigh.  The limb was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Standard anteromedial and anterolateral arthroscopy portals were obtained and a systematic examination of the knee was then performed.  Patellofemoral joint showed frequent chondromalacia.  Examination of the medial compartment showed a displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus involving the entire posterior, parietal, and portion of his anterior portion of the medial meniscus.  The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were unaffected.  Intercondylar notch examination revealed an intact ACL and PCL stable to drawer testing and probing and the lateral compartment showed an intact lateral meniscus.  The femoral condyle and tibial plateau were all stable to probing.  Attention was then directed back to the medial compartment where the detached portion of the meniscus was excised using arthroscopy scissors.  A shaver was then used to smooth all the edges until the margins were stable to probing.,The knee was then flushed with normal saline and suctioned dry.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the knee and into the arthroscopy portals.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were applied followed by a TED hose.

She has done quite well with this.  She now has had worsening left knee pain predominantly on the inside of her knee and has consented for unicompartmental knee replacement on the left.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  After appropriate anesthesia, the left lower extremity was identified with a time out procedure.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  Left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion after applying a thigh tourniquet.  The tourniquet was insufflated after elevation of the limb, and a standard medial parapatellar incision was used.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down the retinaculum, was opened sharply to expose the joint, meniscus that was visible along the tibia was removed.  The anterior fat pad was removed.  The knee was then examined.  The ACL was found to be intact.  The lateral compartment had very minimal arthritis.  There were some osteoarthritic changes of the patellofemoral joint, but these were felt to be mild.  Following this, the tibial external alignment guide was placed and pinned into place in the appropriate place.  Tibial bone cut was made and checked with a feeler gauge and felt to be an adequate resection.  Following this resection, the femoral intramedullary guide was placed without difficulty.  The femoral cutting guide was then placed and referenced off of this femoral intramedullary guide.  Once in the appropriate position, it was pinned and drilled.  This was removed, and the posterior cutting block was inserted.  It was impacted into place.  Posterior bone cut was made for the medium femoral component.  Next, a zero spigot was used and the distal femur was reamed.  Following this, the check of the extension and flexion gaps revealed that an additional 1 mm needed to be reamed, so 1 spigot was used and this was reamed as well.  Next, trial components were placed into the knee and the knee was taken through range of motion and felt to come out to full extension with a 3 mm poly with a good fit.  Next, the tibia was prepared.  The tibial tray was pinned into place, and the cuts for the keel of the tibia were made.  These were removed with a small osteotome from the set.  Following this, a trial tibial with the keel was placed and it did fit nicely.  After this, all trial components were removed.  The knee was copiously irrigated.  Cement was begun mixing.  Drill holes were used along the femur for cement interdigitation.  The wound was cleaned and dried.  Cement was placed on the tibia.  Tibial tray was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  Tibia was placed in the femur.  Femoral component was impacted into place.  Excess cement was removed.  It was held with a 4 mm trial insert and approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion until the cement had hardened.  Following this, it was again trialed with a meniscal bearing implant and it was felt that 3 mm would be the appropriate size.  A 3 mm polyethylene was chosen and inserted in the knee without difficulty, taken through range of motion and found to come out to full extension with no impingement and full flexion.  The intramedullary rod removed from the femur.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The retinaculum was closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 Monocryl was used for the subcutaneous tissue and staples used for the skin.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Tourniquet was then desufflated.  Sponge and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.  Dr. Jinnah was present for the surgery.  The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

This operative note will discuss the right total knee arthroplasty.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,BLOOD LOSS: , Approximately 150 cc.,HISTORY:,  This is a 79-year-old female who has disabling bilateral knee degenerative arthritis.  She has been unresponsive to conservative measures.  All risks, complications, anticipated benefits, and postoperative course were discussed.  The patient has agreed to proceed with surgery as described below.,GROSS FINDINGS: , There was noted to be eburnation and wear along the patellofemoral joint and femoral tibial articulation medially and laterally with osteophyte formation and sclerosis.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The Zimmer NexGen total knee system was utilized.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room #2 and placed in supine position on the operating room table.  She was administered spinal anesthetic by Dr. Z.,The tourniquet was placed about the proximal aspect of the right lower extremity.  The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right lower extremity and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  Longitudinal incision was made over the anterior aspect of the right knee.  Subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected.  A medial parapatellar retinacular incision was made.  The patella was then everted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated.  A drill hole was placed in the distal aspect of the femur and the distal femoral cutting guides were positioned in place.  The appropriate cuts were made at the distal femur as well as with use of the chamfer guide.  The trial femoral component was then positioned in place and noted to have good fit.  Attention was then directed to proximal tibia, the external tibial alignment guide was positioned in place and the proximal tibial cut was made demonstrating satisfactory cut.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments remained intact throughout the procedure as well as the posterior cruciate ligaments.  The remnants of the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci were resected.  The tibial trial was positioned in place.  Intraoperative radiographs were taken, demonstrating satisfactory alignment of the tibial cut.  The tibial holes were then drilled.  The patella was then addressed with the Bovie used to remove the soft tissue around the perimeter of the patella.  The patellar cutting guide was positioned in place and the posterior aspect of the patella was resected to the appropriate thickness.  Three drill holes were made within the patella after it was determined that 35 mm patella would be most appropriate.  The knee was placed through range of motion with the trial components marked and then the appropriate components obtained.  The tibial tray was inserted with cement, backed it into place, excess methylmethacrylate was removed.  The femoral component was inserted with methylmethacrylate.  Any excessive methylmethacrylate and bony debris were removed from the joint.  Trial Poly was positioned in place and the knee was held in full extension while the methylmethacrylate became firm.  The methylmethacrylate was also used at the patella.  The prosthesis was positioned in place.  The patellar clamp held securely till the methylmethacrylate was firm.  After all three components were in place, the knee was then again in placed range of motion and there appeared to be some torsion to the proximal tibial component and concerned regarding the alignment.  This component was removed and revised to a stemmed component with better alignment and position.  The previous component removed, the methylmethacrylate was removed.  Further irrigation was performed and then a stemmed template was positioned in place with the intramedullary alignment guide positioned and the tibia drilled and broached.  The trial tibial stemmed component was positioned in place.  Knee was placed through range of motion and the tracking was better.  Actual component was then obtained, methyl methacrylate was placed within the tibia.  The stemmed tibial component was impacted into place with good fit.  The Poly was then positioned in place.  Knee held in full extension with compression longitudinally after methylmethacrylate was solidified.  The trial Poly was removed.  Wound was irrigated and the joint was inspected.  There was no debris.  Collateral ligaments and posterior cruciate ligaments remained intact.  Soft tissue balancing was done and a 17 mm Poly was then inserted with the knee and tibial and femoral components with good tracking as well as the patellar component.  The tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  A drain was placed into the depths of the wound.  The medial retinacular incision was closed with one Ethibond suture in interrupted fashion.  The knee was placed through range of motion and there was no undue tissue tension, good patellar tracking, no excessive soft tissue laxity or constrain.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 undyed Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with surgical clips.  The exterior of the wound was cleansed as well padded dressing ABDs and ace wrap over the right lower extremity.  At the completion of the procedure, distal pulses were intact.  Toes were pink, warm, with good capillary refill.  Distal neurovascular status was intact.  Postoperative x-ray demonstrated satisfactory alignment of the prosthesis.  Prognosis is good in this 79-year-old female with a significant degenerative arthritis.","surgery, patellofemoral, eburnation, osteophyte, articulation, tibial, femoral, bilateral knee arthroplasty, knee degenerative arthritis, zimmer nexgen, lower extremity, arthroplasty, patella, methylmethacrylate,"

Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes.,COMPONENTS: , A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used.  A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm.  A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used.  A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well.  Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,BRIEF HISTORY:,  The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years.  She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility.  She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table.  Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic.  Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position.  Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position.  Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh.  At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum.  A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface.  There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well.  At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed.  This was done without difficulty.  Attention was then directed removing the femoral component.  Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed.  After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component.  An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose.  There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation.  This was evaluated.  The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component.  The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component.  At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut.  We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut.  We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12.  At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed.  Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis.  Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made.  This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally.  The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide.  The anterior surface cutting block was then placed.  This aligned us to anterior cutting block.,We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis.  Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made.  It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface.  _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on.  This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur.  Once this was placed and pinned in position.  Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut.  It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone.  The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects.  This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component.  After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed.  This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position.  It appeared to be satisfactory.  At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia.  The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained.  At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut.  This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface.  The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component.  At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone.  This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component.  This was placed in a proper position.  A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position.  We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut.  The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis.  At this point, all trials were removed.  The patella was then examined.  The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium.  The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone.  It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed.  At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed.  There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes.  These were removed with a rongeur.,At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes.  Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried.  The tourniquet was then reinflated.  The canals were prepped for cementing.  They were suction-dried and cleaned.  The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial.  Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component.  The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented.  Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation.  A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression.  This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured.  This was then removed and the components were evaluated.  All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed.  Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion.  This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability.  It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly.  This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion.  The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured.  The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion.  The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned.  At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery.  The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion.  This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl.  The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment.  The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage.  At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was approximated with skin clips.  Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed.  A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity.  The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.","surgery, knee arthroplasty, revision, zimmer nexgen, distal femoral, intramedullary guide, femoral component, femoral, knee, arthroplasty, intramedullary, patellar, medial, tibial, "

KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels.,2.  Bone biopsy (medically necessary).,ANESTHESIA:, General,COMPLICATIONS:, None,BLOOD LOSS:, Minimal,INDICATIONS:,  Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating.  She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics.  She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note).,Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2.  In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture.  Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures.  Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1.  Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1.  The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old.  The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity.  Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed.  The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table.  The back was prepped and draped.  The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker.  In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate.  An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side.  Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane.  Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed.  A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex.  AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory.  Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made.  The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place.  The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle.  Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall.  Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel.  The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex.  After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex.  The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images.  The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body.  Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi.  Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position.  The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved.  Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement.  The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side.  Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed.,At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12.  An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved.  Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning.,Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures.  The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection.  She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor.  She was moving both her lower extremities at this time.,Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.","surgery, osteoporosis, pathologic fractures, kyphosis, bone cement, balloon kyphoplasty, kyphon balloon kyphoplasty, bone biopsy, kyphon, insertion of kyphon, ap and lateral, vertebral body, kyphon balloon, anterior cortex, vertebral, body, fractures, insertion, bone, kyphoplasty, guide, balloon, pedicles, cortex, positioned, therapy"

After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table.  Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was carried out from L4 to S1.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization.  A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum.  At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1.  Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space.  At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar.  The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk.  We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root.  Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic.

Risks and benefits of this procedure were discussed with Misty, all of her questions were adequately answered and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room where satisfactory conscious sedation was performed.  She was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Bimanual exam revealed moderate amount of clot in the uterus.  I was able to remove most of the clots with my hands and an attempt at short curettage was performed, but because of contraction of the uterus this was unable to be adequately performed.  I was able to thoroughly examine the uterine cavity with my hand and no remaining clots or placental tissue or membranes were found.  At this point, the procedure was terminated.  Bleeding at this time was minimal.  Preop H&H were 8.3 and 24.2.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in good condition.","surgery, uterus, intrauterine clots, postpartum hemorrhage, intrauterine, curettage, hemorrhage, bleeding, postpartum, clots,"
674, Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft., Surgery, Juxtarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.,OPERATIVE TIME:  Three hours.,ANESTHESIA TIME:  Four hours.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.,The transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.,The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.,First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.,The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.,At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.","surgery, inferior left renal artery, semi continuous prolene suture, juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, inferior mesenteric artery, continuous prolene suture, abdominal aortic aneurysm, hemashield tube, inferior mesenteric, renal artery, aortic aneurysm, aneurysm, iliac, endarterectomy, viscera, hemashield, abdomen, prolene, arteries, juxtarenal, graft, aortic, endotracheal, renal, artery, "

The patient complained of clicking noises and stiffness, which affected his daily activities of living.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risks as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure was discussed at length, the patient's informed consent was obtained.,Operative extremities were then confirmed with the operating surgeons as well as the nursing staff, Department of Anesthesia, and the patient.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to operative suite #2 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was allowed in DVT study and the right extremity was in the Esmarch study as well as the left.  The nonsterile tourniquet was then applied to the right upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  The right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated using 325 mmHg.  The patient was a consideration for a unicompartmental knee replacement.  So, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a limited midline longitudinal incision was made directly over the patella.  A sharp dissection was then taken down to the level of the fascia in line with the patella as well as the quadriceps tendon.  Next, a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed using the #10 blade scalpel.  Upon viewing of the articular surfaces, there was significant ware in the trochlear groove as well as the medial femoral condyle and it was elected to proceed with total knee replacement.  At this time, the skin incisions as well as the deep incisions were extended proximally and distally in a midline fashion.  Total incision now measured approximately 25 cm.  Retractors were placed.  Next, attention was directed to establishing medial and lateral flaps of the proximal tibia.  Reciprocating osteal elevator was used to establish soft tissue plane and then an electrocautery was then used to subperiosteal strip medially and laterally on the proximal tibia.  At this time, the patella was then everted.  The knee was flexed up to 90 degrees.  Next, using the large drill bit, the femoral canal was then opened in appropriate position.  The intramedullary sizing guide was then placed and the knee was sized to a size F. At this time, the three degrees external rotation holes were then drilled after carefully assessing the epicondylar access as well as the white sideline.  The guide was then removed.  The intramedullary guide was then placed with nails holding the guide in three degrees of external rotation.  Next, the anterior femoral resection guide was then placed and clamped into place using a pointed _________________ was then used to confirm that there would no notching performed.  Next, soft tissue retractors were placed and an oscillating saw was used to make the anterior femoral cut.  Upon checking, it was noted to be flat with no oscillations.  The anterior guide was then removed and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in five degrees of valgus.  It was secured in place using nails.  The intramedullary guide was then removed and the standard distal femoral cut was then made using oscillating saw.,This was then removed and the size F distal finishing femoral guide was then placed on the femur in proper position.  Bony and soft tissue landmarks were confirmed and the resection guide was then held in place using nail as well as spring screws.  Again, the collateral ligament retractors were then placed and the oscillating saw was used to make each of the anterior and posterior as well as each chamfer cut.  A reciprocating saw was then used to cut the trochlear cut and the peg holes were drilled as well.  The distal finishing guide was then removed and osteotome was then used to remove all resected bone.  The oscillating saw was then used to complete the femoral notch cut.  Upon viewing, there appeared to be proper amount of bony resection and all bone was removed completely.  There was no posterior osteophytes noted and no fragments to the posterior aspect.  Next, attention was directed towards the tibia.  The external tibial guide was reflected.  This was placed on the anterior tibia and held in place using nails after confirming the proper varus and valgus position.  The resection guide was then checked and appeared to be sufficient amount of resection in both medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  Next, collateral ligament retractors were placed as well as McGill retractors for the PCL.  Oscillating saw was then used to make the proximal tibial cut.  Osteotome was used to remove this excess resected bone.  The laminar spreader was then used to check the flexion and extension.  The gaps appeared to be equal.  The external guide was then removed and trial components were placed to a size F femoral component and a 12 mm tibial component on a size 8 tray.  The knee was taken through range of motion and had very good flexion as well as full extension.  There appeared to be good varus and valgus stability as well.  Next, attention was directed towards the patella.  There noted to be a sufficient ware and it was selected to replace the patella.  It was sized with caliper, pre-cut and noted to be 26 mm depth.  The sizing guide was then used and a size 51 resection guide selected.  A 51 mm reamer was then placed and sufficient amount of patella was then removed.  The calcar was then used to check again and there was noted to be 15 mm remaining.  The 38 mm patella guide was then placed on the patella.  It was noted to be in proper size and the three drill holes for the pegs were used.  A trial component was then placed.  The knee was taken through range of motion.  There was noted to be some subluxation lateral to the patellar component and a lateral release was performed.  After this, the component appeared to be tracking very well.  There remained a good range of motion in the knee and extension as well as flexion.  At this time, an AP x-ray of the knee was taken with the trial components in place.  Upon viewing this x-ray, it appeared that the tibial cut was in neutral, all components in proper positioning.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and dried.  The knee was then flexed ___________ placed, and the peg drill guide was placed on the tibia in proper position, held in place with nails.,The four peg holes were then drilled.  The knee again was copiously irrigated and suction dried.  The final components were then selected again consisting of size F femoral components.  A peg size 8 tibial component, a 12 mm height articular surface, size blue, and a 38 mm 9.5 mm thickness All-Poly patella.  Polymethyl methacrylate was then prepared at this time.  The proximal tibia was dried and the cement was then pressed into place.  The cement was then placed on the backside of the tibial component and the tibial component was then impacted into proper positioning.  Next, the proximal femur was cleaned and dried.  Polymethyl methacrylate was placed on the resected portions of the femur as well as the backside of the femoral components.  This was then impacted in place as well.  At this time, all excess cement was removed from both the tibial and femoral components.  A size 12 mm trial tibial articular surface was then put in place.  The knee was reduced and held in loading position throughout the remaining drying position of the cement.  Next, the resected patella was cleaned and dried.  The cement was placed on the patella as well as the backside of the patellar component.  The component was then put in proper positioning and held in place with a clamp.  All excess polymethyl methacrylate was removed from this area as well.  This was held until the cement had hardened sufficiently.  Next, the knee was examined.  All excess cement was then removed.  The knee was taken through range of motion with sufficient range of motion as well as stability.  The final 12 mm height polyethylene tibial component was then put into place and snapped down in proper position.  Again range of motion was noted to be sufficient.  The knee was copiously irrigated and suction dried once again.  A drain was then placed within the knee.  The wound was then closed first using #1 Ethibond to close the arthrotomy oversewn with a #1 Vicryl.  The knee was again copiously irrigated and dried.  The skin was closed using #2-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion followed by staples on the skin.  The ConstaVac was then _______ to the drain.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, Kerlix, and a 6-inch Dupre roll from foot to thigh.  Department of Anesthesia then reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.","surgery, degenerative, arthritis, zimmer nexgen, all-poly, cruciate, patellar component, total knee arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, tibial component, femoral, patellar, tibial, knee, arthroplasty, anesthesia, "

The patient was brought to the preoperative holding area, where the operative left eye was marked.  He was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  EKG leads were placed.  General anesthesia was induced.  The left ocular surface and periorbital skin were disinfected and draped in the standard fashion for eye surgery after a shield and tape were placed over the unoperated right eye.  A lid speculum was placed.  The posterior segment infusion was placed by the vitreoretinal service.  Peritomy was performed at the 3 and 9 o'clock limbal positions.  A large Flieringa ring was then sutured to the conjunctival surface using 8-0 silk sutures tied in an interrupted fashion.  The cornea was then measured and was found to accommodate a 7.5-mm trephine.  The center of the cornea was marked.  The keratoprosthesis was identified.,A 7.5-mm trephine blade was then used to incise the anterior corneal surface.  This was done after a paracentesis was placed at the 1 o'clock position and viscoelastic was used to dissect peripheral anterior synechiae.  Once the synechiae were freed, the above-mentioned trephination of the anterior cornea was performed.  Corneoscleral scissors were then used to excise completely the central cornea.  The keratoprosthesis was placed in position and was sutured with six interrupted 8-0 silk sutures.  This was done without difficulty.  At this point, the case was turned over to the vitreoretinal team, which will dictate under a separate note.  At the conclusion of the vitreoretinal procedure, the patient was brought under the care of the cornea service.  The 9-0 Prolene sutures double armed were then placed on each lens haptic loop.  The keratoprosthesis was removed.  Prior to this removal, scleral flaps were made, partial thickness at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions underneath the peritomies.  Wet-field cautery also was performed to achieve hemostasis.  The leading hepatic sutures were then passed through the bed of the scleral flap.  These were drawn out of the eye and then used to draw the trailing hepatic into the posterior segment of the eye followed by the optic.  The trailing hepatic was then placed into the posterior segment of the eye as well.  The trailing haptic sutures were then placed through the opposite scleral flap bed and were withdrawn.  These were tied securely into position with the IOL nicely centered.  At this point, the donor cornea punched at 8.25 mm was then brought into the field.  This was secured with four cardinal sutures.  The corneal button was then sutured in place using a 16-bite 10-0 nylon running suture.  The knot was secured and buried after adequate tension was adjusted.  The corneal graft was watertight.  Attention was then turned back to the IOL sutures, which were locked into position.  The ends were trimmed.  The flaps were secured with single 10-0 nylon sutures to the apex, and the knots were buried.  At this point, the case was then turned back over to the vitreoretinal service for further completion of the retinal procedure.  The patient tolerated the corneal portions of the surgery well and was turned over to the retina service in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well.  No complications were noted.  The attending surgeon, Dr. X, performed the entire procedure.  No complications of the procedure were noted.  The intraocular lens was selected from preoperative calculations.

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.","surgery, herniorrhaphy with mesh, laparoscopic, blunt dissector, inguinal herniorrhaphy, inguinal hernia, hernia, inguinal, peritoneum, circumcision, phimosis, foreskin"

The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and opted for an open left inguinal hernial repair with Prolene mesh.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a direct as well as an indirect component to the left inguinal hernia with a large sac.  The patient was also found to have some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for gram stain and turned out to be negative with no organisms.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, the patient was brought to the operative suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  The left inguinal ligament was identified from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS.  Two fingerbreadths above the pubic tubercle, a transverse incision was made.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and then an incision was made with a #15 blade scalpel, approximately 6 cm in length.  Dissection was then carried down with electro Bovie cautery through Scarpa's fascia maintaining hemostasis.  Once the external oblique was identified, external oblique was incised in the length of its fibers with a #15 blade scalpel.  Metzenbaum scissors were then used to extend the incision in both directions opening up the external oblique down to the external ring.  Next, the external oblique was grasped with Ochsner on both sides.  The cord, cord structures as well as hernia sac were freed up circumferentially and a Penrose drain was placed around it.  Next, the hernia sac was identified and the anteromedial portion of the hernia sac was stripped down, grasped with two hemostats.  A Metzenbaum scissor was then used to open the hernia sac and the hernia sac was explored.  There was some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for cultures.  Gram stain was negative for organisms.  Next, the hernia sac was to be ligated at its base and transected.  A peon was used at the base.  Metzenbaum scissor was used to cut the hernia sac and sending it off as a specimen.  An #0 Vicryl stick suture was used with #0 Vicryl loop suture to suture ligate the hernia sac at its base.,Next, attention was made to placing a Prolene mesh to cover the floor.  The mesh was sutured to the pubic tubercle medially along the ilioinguinal ligament inferiorly and along the conjoint tendon superiorly making a slit for the cord and cord structures.  Attention was made to salvaging the ilioinguinal nerve, which was left above the repair of the mesh and below the external oblique once closed and appeared to be intact.  Attention was next made after suturing the mesh with the #2-0 Polydek suture.  The external oblique was then closed over the roof with a running #0 Vicryl suture, taking care not to strangulate the cord and to recreate the external ring.

He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.

The cord structures were then encircled.  Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures.  I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect.  I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac.  Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice.  I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture.  I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament.  I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures.

Plan is for repair of both.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors.  Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal.  The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture.  This was done twice.  The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision.  The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field.  The sac was then opened completely around the testis.  The appendix testis was cauterized.  We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture.  Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely.  Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure.  Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure.

The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  Blood loss was minimal.

He had a hernia repair done on the right in the past, but developed a new hernia on the right and a smaller on the left.  The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in the supine position.  IV antibiotics were given.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A right inguinal incision was made in the previous incisional site with a 15-blade knife, extended down through the subcutaneous tissue and Scarpa fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.,The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised.  There was a moderate amount of scar tissue noted, but we were able to incise that and go down into the right inguinal canal.  Upon dissection there, we did not find any hernias; however, he did have a fairly sizable hydrocele.  We went down towards the external ring and found that this was indeed tight without any hernias.,We then closed up the external oblique fascia and made an incision after doing a shave on the right and left scrotum into the upper scrotal sac with a curvilinear incision with a 15-blade knife.  We then extended down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The hydrocele sac was visualized and then drained after incising into it with a curved Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis was then delivered and found to have a moderate amount of scar tissue with a calcified appendix testis, which was then excised and sent to pathology.  We then checked the upper aspect of the tunica vaginalis pouch and found that there was indeed no other connection, was up above, so we then wrapped the sac around the back of the testis, and closed it with a 4-0 chromic suture in a Lord maneuver.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic and placed the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then used an ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation on both incisional areas with 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine; 15 mL was given.,We performed a similar procedure on the left, incising it at the scrotal area first, rather than below, and found this tunica vaginalis, and dissected it in a similar fashion and cauterized the appendix testis, which was not torsed.  This was a smaller hydrocele, but because of the __________ shunt, we went up above and found that there was a very small connection, which was then dissected off the cord structures gently, twisted upon itself, suture ligated with a 2-0 Vicryl suture.,The ilioinguinal nerve block and other wound instillations again with 15 mL total of 0.25% Marcaine were then done by the surgeon as well.  The external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 2-0 Vicryl.  4-0 chromic was then used to close the Scarpa fascia.  The skin was closed with a 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure.  The scrotal incisions were closed with a subcutaneous and dartos closure using 4-0 chromic.  IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on all 4 incisions.

The bilateral iliac crest harvest was first performed by Dr. X and company under separate OR report.  Once the bone was harvested, surgical templets were used to recontour initially the maxillary graft and the mandibular graft.  Then, CAT scan models were used to find tune and adjust the bony contact regions for the maxillary tricortical block graft and the mandibular tricortical block graft.  Subsequent to the harvest of the bilateral ilium, the intraoral region was scrubbed per routine.  Surgical team scrubbed and gowned in usual fashion and the patient was draped.  Xylocaine 1%, 1:100,000 epinephrine 7 ml was infiltrated into the labial and palatal mucosa.  A primary incision was made in the maxilla starting on the patient's left tuberosity region along the crest of the residual ridge to the contralateral side in similar fashion.  Release incisions were made in the posterior region of the maxilla.,A full-thickness periosteal reflexion first exposed the palatal region.  The contents of the neurovascular canal from the greater palatine foramina were identified.  The hard palate was directly observed.  The facial tissues were then reflected exposing the lateral aspect of the maxilla, the zygomatic arch, the infraorbital nerve, artery and vein, the lateral piriform rim, the inferior piriform rim, and the remaining issue of the nasal spine.  Similar features were reflected on the contralateral side.  The area was re-contoured with rongeurs.  The block of bone, which was formed and harvested from the left ilium was then placed and found to be stable.  A surgical mallet then compressed this bone further into the region.  A series of five 2 mm diameter titanium screws measuring 14 mm to 16 mm long were then used to fixate the block of bone into the residual maxilla.  Particulate bone was then placed around the remaining block of bone.  A piece of AlloDerm mixed with Croften and patient's platelet-rich plasma, which was centrifuged from drawing 20 cc of blood was then mixed together and placed over the lateral aspect of the block.  The tissues were expanded then with a tissue Metzenbaum scissors and once the labial tissue was expanded, the tissues were approximated for primary closure without tension using interrupted and continuous sutures #3-0 Gore-Tex.  Attention was brought then to the mandible.  1% Xylocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in the labial mucosa 5 cc were given.  A primary incision was made between the mental foramina and the residual crest of the ridge and reflected first to the lingual area observing the superior genial tubercle in the facial area degloving the mentalis muscle and exposing the anterior body.  The anterior body was found to be approximately 3 mm in height.  A posterior tunnel was done first on the left side along the mylohyoid ridge and then under retromolar pad to the external oblique and the ridge was then degloved.  A tunnel was formed in the posterior region separating the mental nerve artery and vein from the flap and exposing that aspect of the body of the mandible.  A similar procedure was done on the contralateral side.  The tissues were stretched with tissue scissors and then a high speed instrumentation was used to decorticate the anterior mandible using a 1.6 mm twist drill and a pear shaped bur was used in the posterior region to begin original exploratory phenomenon of repair.  A block of bone was inserted between the mental foramina and fixative with three 16 cm screws first with a twist drill then followed with self-tapping 2 mm diameter titanium screws.  The block of bone was further re-contoured in situ.  Particulate bone was then injected into the posterior tunnels bilaterally.  A piece of AlloDerm was placed over those particulate segments.  The tissues were approximated for primary closure using #3-0 Gore-Tex suture both interrupted and horizontal mattress in form.  The tissues were compressed for about four minutes to allow platelet clots to form and to help adhere the flap.,The estimated blood loss in the harvest of the hip was 100 cc.  The estimated blood loss in the intraoral procedure was 220 cc.  Total blood loss for the procedure 320 cc.  The fluid administered 300 cc.  The urine out 180.  All sponges were counted encountered for as were sutures.

He landed mostly on the right arm.  He noted some bleeding at the time of the injury and a small puncture wound.  He was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed a compound both bone forearm fracture, and based on this, he was seen for malalignment.,He was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure was discussed at length with the patient's parents and they understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain on full range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for repeat debridement, risk of need for internal fixation, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  They understood these well.  All questions were answered and they signed the consent for procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The right forearm was inspected.  There was noted to be a 3-mm puncture-type wound over the volar aspect of the forearm in the middle one-third overlying the radial one-half.  There was bleeding in this region.  No gross contamination was seen.  At this point, under fluoroscopic control, I did attempt to see a fracture.  I was unable to do the forearm under the close reduction techniques.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An incision was made through the puncture wound site extending this proximally and distally.  There was noted to be some slight amount of nonviable tissue at the skin edge and debridement was required and performed.  I also did perform a light debridement of the nonviable subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and small bony fragments were also removed.  These were all completely debrided appropriately and then at this point, a thorough irrigation was performed of the radius, which I communicated through the puncture wound.  Both ends were clearly visualized, and thorough irrigation was performed using total of 6 L of antibiotic solution.  All nonviable gross contaminated tissue was removed.  At this point with the bones in direct visualization, I did reduce the bony ends to anatomic alignment with excellent bony approximation.  Proper alignment of tissue and angulation was confirmed.,At this point, under fluoroscopic control confirmed the radius and ulna in anatomic position, which will be completely displaced and shortened previously.  The ulna was now also noted to be in anatomic alignment.,At this point, the region was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis confirmed and closure then begun.  The skin was reapproximated using 3-0 nylon suture.  The visual puncture wound region was left open and this was intact with the depth of the wound down the bone using 1.5-inch Nugauze with iodoform.  Sterile dressing applied and a long-arm cast with the forearm in neutral position was applied.  X-ray with fluoroscopic evaluation was performed, which confirmed.  They maintained excellent bony approximation and the anatomic alignment.  The long-arm cast was then completely mature.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, compound fracture, mid-shaft radius, ulna, open reduction, irrigation and debridement, subcutaneous, tissues, muscle, bone, forearm, radius and ulna, forearm fracture, anatomic alignment, arm cast, puncture wound, tourniquet, i&d, fracture,"

Limited exploratory laparotomy with removal of foreign body and lysis of adhesions.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After obtaining the informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Under general endotracheal anesthesia, first of all the patient was positioned in the left lateral decubitus and the left gluteal area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The opening of the abscess was probed and there was a tract of about 20 cm going subcutaneously upward.  I proceeded to enlarge the drainage area and to some degree unroofing the tract partially and then the area was débrided and then packed with iodoform gauze and a temporary dressing was applied.,Then, the patient was placed in a supine position, and I proceeded to remove the pigtail catheter after dividing it to undo its locking mechanism.  It came out without any difficulty.  Then, the colostomy was protected and draped apart, and the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  My initial idea was to just drain and debride the wound infection, which had a sinus tract at lower end of the midline incision.  I initially probed the wound with a hemostat and this had at least 12 cm long tract and I proceeded to excise the badly scarred skin that was on top of it and then continued the dissection to the fascia and I realized that the sinus tract was going through the fascia into the abdomen.  Very carefully, I started dividing the fascia.  Of course, there were several small bowel loops adhered to the area.  The dissection was quite tedious for a while.  Initially, I thought that may be there was an enterocutaneous fistula in the area, but then I realized that the tissue that was interpreted as an intestinal mucosa was actually a very smooth __________ tissue that was walling the sinus tract.  I made a laparotomy of about 10 cm and I carefully dissected the bowel of the fascia.  There was an area at the bottom which looked like a foreign body and initially I thought there was a mesh that can be used to close the abdomen, but later on this substance floated out by self and it was an elongated strip, maybe about 6 cm, which we sent to Pathology for examination.  Initially, I have obtained a sample for culture and sensitivity for aerobic and anaerobic organisms.,I was very happy that we were not really dealing with enterocutaneous fistula.  The area was irrigated generously with saline and then we closed the fascia with number of interrupted figure-of-eight sutures of heavy PPS.  The subcutaneous tissue and the skin were left open and packed with Betadine-soaked sponges.,A dressing was applied.  A small dressing was applied to the area where we removed the pigtail catheter and also we went down to the gluteal area and put a formal dressing in that area.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was minimal, and he was sent to the ICU and also made acute care because of the need for a laparotomy, which we were not anticipating.","surgery, intraperitoneal pigtail catheter, postoperative wound infection, foreign body, intraperitoneal, exploratory laparotomy, enterocutaneous fistula, wound infection, sinus tract, gluteal abscess, pigtail catheter, i&d, abscess, laparotomy, fascia, pigtail, catheter, gluteal, incision, foreign"

The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap across his lap.  General anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The stockinette was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  There was noted to be some remaining periwound erythema.  There was noted to be some mild crepitation about 2 cm proximal from the entry wound.  The entry wound was noted to be over the third metatarsal head dorsally.  Upon inspection of the wound, there was noted to be hard foreign filling substance deep within the wound.  The entry site from the foreign body was extended proximally approximately about 0.5 cm.  At this time, a large wooden foreign body was visualized and removed with a straight stat.,The area was carefully inspected for any remaining piece of foreign body.  Several small pieces were noted and they were removed.  The area was palpated and there was no more remaining foreign body noted.  At this time, the wound was inspected thoroughly.  There was noted to be an area along the third metatarsal head more distally that did probe to the bone.  There was no purulent drainage expressed.  Area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Pulse lavage was performed with 3 liters of plain sterile saline.  Wound cultures were obtained, aerobic and aerobic.  The wound was then again inspected for any remaining foreign body or purulent drainage.  None was noticed.  The wound was packed with sterile new gauze packing lately and dressings consisted of 4x4s, ABDs, Kling, and Kerlix.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.

The patient was intubated by anesthesia orotracheally using a #7 ET tube.  The patient was induced in effective sleep using a propofol and gas inhalation anesthetics.  Following intubation, the patient's mouth was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a toothbrush following placement of a throat pack.  At that point, approximately 5 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:20,000 epinephrine was injected for a right inferior alveolar block, as well as local infiltration in the right long buccal nerve area as well as the right cheek area.  Local infiltration also was done near the tooth #32.  At this point, a periosteal elevator was used to loosen up the gingival tissue of the teeth #1, #29, and #32; and all 3 teeth were extracted using simple extraction, using elevators and forceps.  In addition, the previous Penrose drain was removed by removing the suture, and the incision that was used for I&D on the previous day was extended laterally.  A hemostat was used to puncture through to the right buccal space.  Approximately, 2.5 to 3 mL of purulence was drained, and that was used for Gram stain and culture, as mentioned above.

He had severe peripheral vascular disease and recently underwent a kidney transplant.  He has had some troubles with increasing serum creatinine and hypertension.  Duplex suggests a high-grade iliac stenosis just proximal to his transplant kidney.  He is brought to the operating room for arteriography and potential treatment of this.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to operating room #14.  A condom catheter was put in place.  Preoperative antibiotics were administered.  The patient's left arm was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made over his brachial artery after anesthetizing the skin.  His brachial artery was dissected free and looped with vessel loops.  Under direct vision, it was punctured with an 18-gauge needle and a short 3J guidewire and 6-French sheath put in place.  A 3J guidewire was then introduced after the administration of intravenous heparin and advanced into the descending thoracic aorta.  This was then advanced down into the right common iliac artery.  The catheter was placed over this and arteriography performed.  After adjusting the image intensifier to unfold the origin of the renal artery from the iliac system.  We were able to demonstrate an approximately 60-70% stenosis of the external iliac artery.  Immediately preceding the origin of the artery for the transplant kidney, which appeared to be widely patent.  We elected to try and treat this.  With catheter support a magic torque guidewire was advanced through the stenosis and into the common femoral artery.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length angioplasty balloon was positioned across the stenosis and inflated.  This inflation was held for one minute.  This was then deflated and a catheter positioned again in the proximal common iliac artery.  For this application, we used a guide catheter that would allow us to inject contrast without losing our wire purchase.  This showed an improvement in the stenosis, but a residual stenosis of at least 30% and we elected to stent this.  An 8 mm diameter x 3 cm length stent was chosen and placed just proximal to the origin of the renal artery.  After this was completed, the stent introduction balloon was removed and the catheter replaced.  Repeat angiography showed a widely patent segment with no evidence of any residual stenosis.  There was no evidence of any dissection or damage to the renal artery.  We interpreted this as satisfactory procedure.  Guidewires and sheaths were removed.  The brachial artery was repaired with two interrupted sutures of 7-0 Prolene.  The wound was irrigated and the subcutaneous tissue closed with a running suture of Vicryl.  The skin was reapproximated with a running intracuticular suture of Monocryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile occlusive dressing were applied and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Estimated blood loss for the procedure was less than 50 mL.

She has subsequently been on tamoxifen.  Ultrasound did show a thickened endometrial stripe as well as an adnexal cyst.  The above procedures were therefore performed.,FINDINGS:  ,On bimanual exam, the uterus was found to be slightly enlarged and anteverted.  The external genitalia was normal.  Hysteroscopic findings revealed both ostia well visualized and a large polyp on the anterolateral wall of the endometrium.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a normal-appearing uterus and normal left ovary.  There was no evidence of endometriosis on the ovaries bilaterally, the ovarian fossa, the cul-de-sac, or the vesicouterine peritoneum.  There was a cyst on the right ovary which appeared simple in nature.  The cyst was aspirated and the fluid was blood tinged.  Therefore, the decision to perform oophorectomy was made.  The liver margins appeared normal and there were no pelvic or abdominal adhesions noted.  The polyp removed from the hysteroscopic portion of the exam was found to be 4 cm in size.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the posterior vaginal vault in the 12 o'clock position and the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then sounded in the anteverted position to 10 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank and Hegar dilators up to a Hank dilator of 20 and Hagar dilator of 10.  The hysteroscope was then inserted and the above findings were noted.  A sharp curette was then introduced and the 4 cm polyp was removed.  The hysteroscope was then reinserted and the polyp was found to be completely removed at this point.  The polyp was sent to Pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed as a means to manipulate the uterus.  The weighted speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed.  Attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Using a sterile saline drop test, appropriate placement was confirmed.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume inflow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was placed without difficulty.  The above findings were then visualized.  A 5 mm port was placed 2 cm above the pubic symphysis.  This was done under direct visualization and the grasper was inserted through this port for better visualization.  A 12 mm port was then made in the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and the Endo-GIA was inserted through this port and the fallopian tube and ovary were incorporated across the infundibulopelvic ligament.  Prior to this, the cyst was aspirated using 60 cc syringe on a needle.  Approximately, 20 cc of blood-tinged fluid was obtained.  After the ovary and fallopian tube were completely transected, this was placed in an EndoCatch bag and removed through the lateral port site.  The incision was found to be hemostatic.  The area was suction irrigated.  After adequate inspection, the port sites were removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was desufflated.  The infraumbilical port site and laparoscope were also removed.  The incisions were then repaired with #4-0 undyed Vicryl and dressed with Steri-Strips.  10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then injected locally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

She had severe dyspareunia and chronic suprapelvic pain.  The patient had had a prior left salpingoophorectomy laparoscopically in 2004 for same disease process.  Now, she presented with a recurrent right ovarian endometrioma and severe pelvic pain.  She desired surgical treatment.  She accepted risk of a complete hysterectomy and salpingoophorectomy, risk of injury to underlying organs.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives were clearly discussed with the patient as documented in the medical record.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , Absent left adnexa.  Right ovary about 6 cm with chocolate cyst and severely adherent to the right pelvic side wall, uterus, and colon.  Careful dissection to free right ovary and remove it although it is likely that some ovarian tissue remains behind.  Ureter visualized and palpated on right and appears normal.  Indigo carmine given IV with no leaks intraperitoneally noted.  Sigmoid colon dissected free from back of uterus and from cul-de-sac.  Bowel free of lacerations or denudation.  Upon inspection, right tube with hydrosalpinx, appendix absent.  Omental adhesions to ensure abdominal wall was lysed.,TECHNICAL PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent smooth induction of general anesthesia.  She was placed in a supine position with a transurethral Foley in place and compression stockings in place.  The abdomen and vagina were thoroughly prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with the scalpel and carried down sharply to the underlying layer of fascia and peritoneum.  The peritoneum was bluntly entered and the incision extended caudally and cephaladly with good visualization of underlying organs.  Next, exploration of the abdominal and pelvic organs revealed the above noted findings.  The uterus was enlarged and probably contained adenomyosis.  There were dense adhesions, and a large right endometrioma with a chocolate cyst-like material contained within.  The sigmoid colon was densely adhered to the cul-de-sac into the posterior aspect of the uterus.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed into the incision, and the bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges.  Next, a sharp and blunt dissection was used to free the extensive adhesions, and enterolysis was performed with very careful attention not to injure or denude the bowel.  Next, the left round ligament and cornual region was divided, transected, and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and opened anteriorly to the level of the bladder.  The uterine arteries were skeletonized on the left, and these were suture-clamped and transected with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the bladder flap was developed anteriorly, and the bladder peritoneum was sharply and bluntly dissected off of the lower uterus.,On the right, a similar procedure was performed.  The right round ligament was suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  It was transected and divided with electrocautery.  The anterior and posterior leafs of the broad ligament were dissected and developed anteriorly and posteriorly, and this area was relatively avascular.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was identified.  It was cross-clamped and transected, suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb with good hemostasis noted.  Next, the uterine arteries were skeletonized on the right.  They were transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The uterosacral ligaments were taken bilaterally and transected and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  The cardinal ligaments were taken near their insertion into the cervical and uterine tissue.  Pedicles were sharply developed and suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb.  Next, the electrocautery was used to dissect the cervix anteriorly from the underlying vagina.  Once entry into the vagina was made, the cervix and uterus were amputated with Jorgensen scissors.  The vaginal cuff angles were suture-ligated with 0 Polysorb and transfixed to the ipsilateral, cardinal, and uterosacral ligaments for vaginal support.  The remainder of the vagina was closed with figure-of-eight sutures in an interrupted fashion with good hemostasis noted.,Next, the right ovarian tissue was densely adherent to the colon.  It was sharply and bluntly dissected, and most of the right ovary and endometrioma was removed and dissected off completely; however, there is a quite possibility that small remnants of ovarian tissue were left behind.  The right ureter was seen and palpated.  It did not appear to be dilated and had good peristalsis noted.  Next, the retractors were removed.  The laparotomy sponges were removed from the abdomen.  The rectus fascia was closed with 0 Polysorb in a continuous running fashion with 2 sutures meeting in the midline.  The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 0 plain gut in an interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Polysorb in a subcuticular fashion.  A thin layer of Dermabond was placed.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x 2.

The block was performed at 8 o'clock as well with 5 ml at 10 and 2 o'clock.  The lidocaine was injected into the cervix.  The cervix was minimally dilated with #17 Hanks dilator.  The 5-mm 30-degree hysteroscope was then inserted under direct visualization using lactated Ringer's as a distention medium.  The uterine cavity was viewed and the above normal findings were noted.  The Essure tubal occlusion was then inserted through the operative port and the tip of the Essure device easily slid into the right ostia.  The coil was advanced and easily placed and the device withdrawn.  There were three coils into the uterine cavity after removal of the insertion device.  The device was removed and reloaded.  The advice was to advance under direct visualization and the tip was inserted into the left ostia.  This passed easily and the device was inserted.  It was removed easily and three coils again were into the uterine cavity.  The hysteroscope was then removed and the ThermaChoice ablation was performed.  The uterus was then sounded to 9.5 to 10 cm.  The ThermaChoice balloon was primed and pressure was drawn to a negative 150.  The device was then moistened and inserted into the uterine cavity and the balloon was slowly filled with 40 ml of D5W.  The pressure was brought up to 170 and the cycle was initiated.  A full cycle of eight minutes was performed.  At no time there was a significant loss of pressure from the catheter balloon.  After the cycle was complete, the balloon was deflated and withdrawn.  The tenaculum was withdrawn.  No bleeding was noted.  The patient was then awakened, transferred, and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, menorrhagia, essure, hysteroscopy, thermachoice, uterine cavity, endometrial ablation, endometrium, fibroids, fluffy, lactated ringer, nulliparous, paracervical block, permanent sterilization, polyps, tubal occlusion, tubal ostia, lactated ringer's, ablation, uterine, "

She presents for suture removal; however, there is still fluid noted now at the antihelix fold above the concha bullosa below previous sutures placed by Dr. X.  It was recommended that this area be drained through the previous incision and drainage incision which has healed and wound care by the patient appears to be very poor if any at all being performed which may be complicating matters.  Consent was obtained.  The patient is aware that the complications with this ear area severe and auricular deformity is inevitable; however, quick prompt aggressive drainage addressing fluid collections offers a best chance for improvement from an already very difficult situation.,The area was prepped in the usual manner, localized and the previous incision was reopened with a curved hemostat and about 5 mL of serosanguineous drainage was noted.  A through-and-through Keith needle bolster dressing was applied with cottonoid pledget on both sides of the ear to help compression.  She tolerated this procedure very well.","surgery, bolster dressing placement, antihelix fold, incision and drainage, bolster dressing, auricular hematoma, auricular, hematoma, incision, drainage"

The plan is for repair.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in the supine position.  The foreskin was retracted and cleansed.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans.  The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French.  We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen.,We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff.  We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap.  Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection.  He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck.  We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight.  We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them.  Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings.  The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate.  The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter.  We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl.  We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well.  5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans.  Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff.  On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect.,At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place.

She was counseled to undergo staging laparotomy.,FINDINGS:,  Examination under anesthesia revealed a small uterus with no nodularity.  During the laparotomy, the uterus was small, mobile, and did not show any evidence of extrauterine spread of disease.  Other abdominal viscera, including the diaphragm, liver, spleen, omentum, small and large bowel, and peritoneal surfaces, were palpably normal.  There was no evidence of residual neoplasm after removal of the uterus.  The uterus itself showed no serosal abnormalities and the tubes and ovaries were unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthesia was induced, after which she was examined, prepped and draped.,A vertical midline incision was made and fascia was divided.  The peritoneum was entered without difficulty and washings were obtained.  The abdomen was explored with findings as noted.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneal spaces were opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided, and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.,Retroperitoneal spaces were then opened, allowing exposure of pelvic vessels and ureters.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments were isolated, divided, and doubly ligated.  The uterine artery pedicles were skeletonized, clamped, divided, and suture ligated.  Additional pedicles were developed on each side of the cervix, after which tissue was divided and suture ligated.  When the base of the cervix was reached, the vagina was cross-clamped and divided, allowing removal of the uterus with attached tubes and ovaries.  Angle stitches of o-Vicryl were placed, incorporating the uterosacral ligaments and the vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.

She had a recent D&C and laparoscopy, and enlarged mass was noted and could not be determined if it was from the ovary or the uterus.  Curettings were negative for malignancy.  The patient did have a large cystocele and rectocele, and a collapsed anterior and posterior vaginal wall.,Upon laparotomy, there was a giant uterine tumor extending from the pelvis up to the above the umbilicus compatible with approximately four to five-month pregnancy.  The ovaries appeared to be within normal limits.  There was marked adherence between the bladder and the giant uterus and mass with edema and inflammation, and during dissection, a laceration inadvertently occurred and it was immediately recognized.  No other pathology noted from the abdominal cavity or adhesions.  The upper right quadrant of the abdomen compatible with a previous gallbladder surgery.  The appendix is in its normal anatomic position.  The ileum was within normal limits with no Meckel's diverticulum seen and no other gross pathology evident.  There was no evidence of metastasis or tumors in the left lobe of the liver.,Upon frozen section, diagnosis of initial and partial is that of a degenerating uterine fibroid rather than a malignancy.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room, prepped and draped in the low lithotomy position under general anesthesia.  A midline incision was made around the umbilicus down to the lower abdomen.  With a #10 Bard Parker blade knife, the incision was carried down through the fascia.  The fascia was incised in the midline, muscle fibers were splint in the midline, the peritoneum was grasped with hemostats and with a #10 Bard Parker blade after incision was made with Mayo scissors.  A Balfour retractor was placed into the wound.  This giant uterus was soft and compatible with a possible leiomyosarcoma or degenerating fibroid was handled with care.  The infundibular ligament on the right side was isolated and ligated with #0 Vicryl suture brought to an avascular area, doubly clamped and divided from the ovary and the ligament again re-ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The right round ligament was ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, brought to an avascular space within the broad ligament and divided from the uterus.  The infundibulopelvic ligament on the left side was treated in a similar fashion as well as the round ligament.  An attempt was made to dissect the bladder flap from the anterior surface of the uterus and this was remarkably edematous and difficult to do, and during dissection the bladder was inadvertently entered.  After this was immediately recognized, the bladder flap was wiped away from the anterior surface of the uterus.  The bladder was then repaired with a running locking stitch #0 Vicryl suture incorporating serosal muscularis mucosa and then the second layer of overlapping seromuscular sutures were used to make a two-layer closure of #0 Vicryl suture.  After removing the uterus, the bladder was tested with approximately 400 cc of sterile water and there appeared to be no leak.  Progressing and removing of the uterus was then carried out and the broad ligament was clamped bilaterally with a straight Ochsner forceps and divided from the uterus with Mayo scissors, and the straight Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture thus controlling the uterine blood supply.  The cardinal ligaments containing the cervical blood supply was serially clamped bilaterally with a curved Ochsner forceps, divided from the uterus with #10 Bard Parker blade knife and a curved Ochsner was placed by #0 Vicryl suture.  The cervix was again grasped with a Lahey tenaculum and pubovesicocervical ligament was entered and was divided using #10 Bard Parker blade knife and then the vaginal vault and with a double pointed sharp scissors.  A single-toothed tenaculum was placed on the cervix and then the uterus was removed from the vagina using hysterectomy scissors.  The vaginal cuff was then closed using a running #0 Vicryl suture in locking stitch incorporating all layers of the vagina, the cardinal ligaments of the lateral aspect and uterosacral ligaments on the posterior aspect.  The round ligaments were approximated to the vaginal cuff with #0 Vicryl suture and the bladder flap approximated to the round ligaments with #000 Vicryl suture.  The ______ was re-peritonealized with #000 Vicryl suture and then the cecum brought into the incision.  The pelvis was irrigated with approximately 500 cc of water.  The appendix was grasped with Babcock forceps.  The mesoappendix was doubly clamped with curved hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  The curved hemostats were placed with #00 Vicryl suture.  The base of the appendix was ligated with #0 plain gut suture, doubly clamped and divided from the distal appendix with #10 Bard Parker blade knife, and the base inverted with a pursestring suture with #00 Vicryl.  No bleeding was noted.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were found to be correct.  All packs and retractors were removed.  The peritoneum muscle fascia was closed in single-layer closure using running looped #1 PDS, but prior to closure, a Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz cystourethropexy was carried out by dissecting the space of Retzius identifying the urethra in the vesical junction approximating the periurethral connective tissue to the symphysis pubis with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Following this, the abdominal wall was closed as previously described and the skin was closed using skin staples.  Attention was then turned to the vagina, where the introitus of the vagina was grasped with an Allis forceps at the level of the Bartholin glands.  An incision was made between the mucous and the cutaneous junction and then a midline incision was made at the posterior vaginal mucosa in a tunneling fashion with Metzenbaum scissors.  The flaps were created bilaterally by making an incision in the posterior connective tissue of the vagina and wiping the rectum away from the posterior vaginal mucosa, and flaps were created bilaterally.  In this fashion, the rectocele was reduced and the levator ani muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #0 Vicryl suture.  Excess vaginal mucosa was excised and the vaginal mucosa closed with running #00 Vicryl suture.  The bulbocavernosus and transverse perinei muscles were approximated in the midline with interrupted #00 Vicryl suture.  The skin was closed with a running #000 plain gut subcuticular stitch.

The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia revealed an anteverted uterus and no adnexal masses.  The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed in the patient's bladder.  The patient's cervix was visualized with speculum.  A single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix.  A HUMI uterine manipulator was placed through the internal os of the cervix and the balloon was inflated.  The tenaculum and speculum were then removed from the vagina.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a small infraumbilical incision was made with scalpel.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the patient's abdomen was inflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  Veress needle was removed and then 5-mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision.  Laparoscope was placed through this incision and the patient's abdominal contents were visualized.  A 2nd trocar incision was placed in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis and a 5-mm trocar was placed through this incision on direct visualization for laparoscope.  A trocar incision was made in the right lower quadrant.  A 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  A ___ trocar incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a 2nd 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  The patient's abdominal and pelvic anatomy were again visualized with the assistance of a blunt probe.  The Gyrus cautery was used to cauterize and cut the right and left round ligaments.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was bluntly dissected and cauterized and cut in an inferior fashion towards lower uterine segment.  The right uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  The uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The Gyrus was then used to cauterize the right uterine vessels.  Gyrus was then used on the left side to cauterize and cut the left round ligament.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament on the left side was bluntly dissected, cauterized, and cut.  Using the Gyrus, the left uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut and the left uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The left uterine vessels were then cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  At this point, as the uterine vessels had been cauterized on both sides, the uterine body exhibited blanching.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel hook was used to amputate the uterine body from the cervix at the level just below the uterine vessels.  The HUMI manipulator was removed prior to amputation of the uterine body.  After the uterine body was detached from the cervical stump, morcellation of the uterine body was performed using the uterine morcellator.  The uterus was removed in a piecemeal fashion through the right lower quadrant trocar incision.  Once, all fragments of the uterus were removed from the abdominal cavity, the pelvis was irrigated.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to cauterize the remaining endocervical canal.  The cervical stump was also cauterized with the Harmonic scalpel and good hemostasis was noted at the cervical stump and also at the sites of all pedicles.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to incise the right ovarian simple cyst.  The right ovarian cyst was then drained yielding straw-colored fluid.  The site of right ovarian cystotomy was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ureters were identified on both sides and noted to be intact throughout the visualized course.  All instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was deflated.  The fascial defects at the 10-mm trocar sites were closed using figure-of-8 sutures of 0-Vicryl and skin incisions were closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  The cervix was then visualized with the speculum.  Good hemostasis at the site of tenaculum insertion was obtained using silver nitrate sticks.  All instruments were removed from the patient's vagina and the patient was placed in normal supine position.,Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, supracervical hysterectomy, incision, uterine, uteroovarian, hysterectomy, supracervical, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, cervical, laparoscopic, laparoscope, cervix, ligaments, trocar"

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  IV antibiotic was given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and the patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans for traction.  His urethra was calibrated, it was quite thin, to a 10-French with the straight sounds.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the urethral plate as well as the penile shaft skin with marking pen and incised the coronal cuff circumferentially and then around the urethral plate with the 15 blade knife and then degloved the penis with a curved tenotomy scissors.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The ventral chordee tissue was removed.  We then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline did an artificial erection test, which showed that he had a persistent chordee.  In the midline a 15 blade knife was used to incise Buck fascia after marking the area of chordee with the marking pen.  We then used a Heinecke-Mikulicz Nesbit tuck with 5-0 Prolene to straighten the penis.  Artificial erection again performed showed the penis was straight.  The knot was buried with figure-of-eight suture of 7-0 Vicryl in Buck fascia above it.  We then left the tourniquet in place and then after marking the urethral plate incised it and enlarged it with Beaver blade and a 15 blade.  We then elevated the glanular wings as well in the similar fashion.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed and the urethral plate was then closed over this with a distal interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl and then a running subcuticular closure of 7-0 Vicryl to close the defect.  We then put the stay sutures in the inter-preputial skin with 7-0 Vicryl and then rotated a flap using the subcutaneous tissue after dissecting it down to the pubis at the base of the penile shaft on the dorsum using the curved iris scissors.  We buttonholed the flap and then placed it through the penis as a sleeve.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl then used to reapproximate and to tack this flap and place over the urethroplasty.  Once this was done, a two 5-0 Vicryl deep sutures were placed in the glans to rotate the glans and allow for hemostasis.  Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were then used to create the neomeatus and horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl used to reconstitute the glans.  We then removed the excessive preputial skin and using tacking sutures of 6-0 chromic tacked the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum we dropped a portion of the skin down on the left side of the penis to reconstitute the penoscrotal junction using horizontal mattress sutures.  We then closed the ventral defect.  Once this was done, the stay suture in the glans was used to keep the Zaontz catheter to tack it into place.

He has received BCG.  The patient is doing well.  The patient was supposed to come to the OR for surveillance biopsy and pyelograms.  The patient had a large left hydrocele, which was increasingly getting worse and was making it very difficult for the patient to sit to void or put clothes on, etc.  Options such as watchful waiting, drainage in the office, and hydrocelectomy were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, infection in the scrotum, enlargement of the scrotum, recurrence, and pain were discussed.  The patient understood all the options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.,A transverse scrotal incision was made over the hydrocele sac and the hydrocele fluid was withdrawn.  The sac was turned upside down and sutures were placed.  Careful attention was made to ensure that the cord was open.  The testicle was in normal orientation throughout the entire procedure.  The testicle was placed back into the scrotal sac and was pexed with 4-0 Vicryl to the outside dartos to ensure that there was no risk of torsion.  Orchiopexy was done at 3 different locations.  Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery.  The sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl.  The sac was turned upside down so that when it heals, the fluid would not recollect.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl and Dermabond was applied.  Incision measured about 2 cm in size.  Subsequently using ACMI cystoscope, a cystoscopy was performed.  The urethra appeared normal.  There was some scarring at the bulbar urethra, but the scope went in through that area very easily into the bladder.  There was a short prostatic fossa.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was some moderate trabeculation throughout the bladder, some inflammatory changes in the bag part, but nothing of much significance.  There were no papillary tumors or stones inside the bladder.  Bilateral pyelograms were obtained using 8-French cone-tip catheter, which appeared normal.  A cold cup biopsy of the bladder was done and was fulgurated for hemostasis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure after emptying the bladder.,The patient was given antibiotics and was told to take it easy.  No heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.  Plan was to follow up in about 2 months.","surgery, hydrocele, fulguration, bladder biopsy, hydrocelectomy, cystopyelogram, cystopyelogram bladder, bladder cancer, bladder,"

Once he was anesthetized, he was then shaved, prepped, and then sterilely prepped and draped.  IV antibiotics were given.  Ancef 1 g given.  A scrotal incision was then made in the right hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  Once we got to the hydrocele sac itself, we then opened and delivered the testis, drained clear fluid.  There was moderate amount of scarring on the testis itself from the tunica vaginalis.  It was then wrapped around the back and sutured in place with a running suture of 4-0 chromic in a Lord maneuver.  Once this was done, a drain was placed in the base of the scrotum and then the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  A similar procedure was performed on the left, which has also had a hydrocele of the cord, which were both addressed and closed with Lord maneuver similarly.  This testis also was normal but had moderate amount of scarring on the tunic vaginalis from this.  A similar drain was placed.  The testes were then placed back into the scrotum in a proper orientation, and the local wound instillation and wound block was then placed using 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine without epinephrine.

Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given.  The dorsal hood was retracted and cleansed.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was then placed in the glans.  His urethra was calibrated to 10-French bougie-a-boule.  We then marked the coronal cuff and the penile shaft skin, as well as the periurethral meatal area on the ventrum.  Byers flaps were also marked.  Once this was done, the skin was then incised around the coronal cuff with 15-blade knife and further extended with the curved tenotomy scissors to deglove the penis.  On the ventrum, the chordee tissue was removed and dissected up towards the urethral plate to use as secondary tissue flap coverage.  Once this was done, an electrocautery was used for hemostasis were then used.  A vessel loop tourniquet and IV grade saline was used for achieve artificial erection and chordee.  We then incised Buck fascia at the area of chordee in the ventrum and then used the #5-0 Prolene as a Heinecke-Mikulicz advancement suture.  Sutures were placed burying the knot and then artificial erection was again performed showing the penis was straight.  We then left the tourniquet in place, although loosened it slightly and then marked out the transurethral incision plate with demarcation for the glans and the ventral midline of the plate.  We then incised it with the ophthalmic micro lancet blade in the midline and along the __________ to elevate the glanular wings.  Using the curved iris scissors, we then elevated the wings even further.  Again, electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  An 8-French Zaontz catheter was then placed into the urethral plate and then interrupted suture of #7-0 Vicryl was used to mark the distal most extent of the urethral meatus and then the urethral plate was rolled using a subcutaneous closure using the #7-0 Vicryl suture.  There were two areas of coverage with the tissue flap relocation from the glanular wings.  The tissue flap that was rolled with the Byers flap was used to cover this, as well as the chordee tissue with interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl.  Once this was completed, the glans itself had been rolled using two deep sutures of #5-0 Vicryl.  Interrupted sutures of #7-0 Vicryl were used to create the neomeatus and then horizontal mattress sutures of #7-0 Vicryl used to roll the glans in the midline.  The extra dorsal hood tissue of preputial skin was then excised.  An interrupted sutures of #6-0 chromic were then used to approximate penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff and on the ventrum around the midline.  The patient's scrotum was slightly asymmetric; however, this was due to the tissue configuration of the scrotum itself.  At the end of the procedure, stay suture of #4-0 Prolene was used to tack the drain into place and a Dermabond and Surgicel were used for dressing.  Telfa and the surgical eye tape was then used for the final dressing.  IV Toradol was given.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","surgery, tissue flap relocation, urethroplasty plate incision, penile shaft skin, chordee release, zaontz catheter, penile shaft, hypospadias repair, flap relocation, coronal cuff, urethral plate, tissue flap, hypospadias, flap, chordee,"

After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted.  At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position.  The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine.  A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated.  After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken.  This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level.  Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified.  After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken.  This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time.  At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina.  The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe.  This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur.  However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone.  Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area.  After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur.  At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed.  However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade.  Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery.  After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin.  Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches.  The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon.

The right arm, axilla, and chest wall were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Longitudinal skin incision was made from the lower axilla distally down the medial aspect of the arm and the basilic vein was not apparent.  The draining veins are the deep brachial veins.  The primary vein was carefully dissected out and small tributaries clamped, divided, and ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  A nice length of vein was obtained to the distal one third of the arm.  This appeared to be of adequate length to transpose the vein through the subcutaneous tissue to an old occluded fistula vein, which remains patent through a small collateral vein.  A transverse skin incision was made over the superior aspect of the old fistula vein.  This vein was carefully dissected out and encircled with vascular tapes.  The brachial vein was then tunneled in a gentle curve above the bicep to the level of the cephalic vein fistula.  The patient was sensible, was then systemically heparinized.  The existing fistula vein was clamped proximally and distally, incised longitudinally for about a centimeter.  The brachial vein end was spatulated.  Subsequently, a branchial vein to arterialized fistula vein anastomosis was then constructed using running #6-0 Prolene suture in routine fashion.  After the completion of the anastomosis, the fistula vein was forebled and the branchial vein backbled.  The anastomosis was completed.  A nice thrill could be palpated over the outflow brachial vein.  Hemostasis was noted.  A 8 mm Blake drain was placed in the wound and brought out through inferior skin stab incision and ___ the skin with #3-0 nylon suture.  The wounds were then closed using interrupted #4-0 Vicryl and deep subcutaneous tissue ___ staples closed the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.

She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull. , Surgery, Hemicraniectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: ,  The patient is a patient well known to my service.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit.","surgery, large hemicraniectomy, intracranial pressure, multiple fractures, skull, traumatic brain injury, mayfield headholder, injury, hemicraniectomyNOTE"

The hemangioma has involved at her upper tongue.  There has not been any change in the last 6 months.  We have discussed with the parents the situation and decided to proceed with the debulking of the nasal tip hemangioma.  They understand the nature of the incision, the nature of the surgery, and the possibility of future revision surgeries.  They understand the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, need for future revision surgery, and minor asymmetry.  They wished to proceed with surgery.,Because of the procedure, informed consent is obtained.  The patient is taken to operating room and placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic is administrated to an oroendotracheal tube.  The face is prepped and draped in the usual manner.  The incision is designed to the lower aspect of the hemangioma, which corresponds to the columella and upper lip junction and then the remaining of the incision is designed as an open rhinoplasty with bilateral rim incisions.  The area is infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine.  We waited 7 minutes for the hemostatic effect and proceeded with the incision.  The incision was then done with a 15 C blade starting at the columella and then going laterally to the level of the rim and the double hook is placed at the level of the dome and the intracartilage incision is done through the mucosa, then extended laterally and upward to follow the lower lateral cartilage.  This is done in both sides.  Further incision is done.  A small tenotomy scissors is used and with the help of retraction of the lower lateral cartilage, the hemangioma is separated gently from the lower lateral cartilage on both sides and I proceeded to leave that the central part of the incision lifting up the entire columella to the level of the nasal tip.  The hemangioma is removed and is found to be involving the medial aspects of both medial crura.  This gently separated from the medial crura and from the soft tissue care is taken not to remove the entire hemangioma from the skin as the nose not to devascularize the distal columella portion.  Hemostasis is achieved with electrocautery.  Then, we proceed to place some interdomal stitches with the help of a 6-0 clear nylon and intercrural stitches are placed and then an interdomal stitch, a single one was placed.  The skin is redraped and the nose found to have satisfactory shape.  The columellar piece was tailored on the lateral aspect corresponding to rim incisions to match the newly created width of the columella.  Portions of skin and hemangioma are taken laterally on both sides of the columella distally.  The skin was closed with 6-0 mild chromic stitches, including the portion at the level of the columella and rim incisions medially.  The remaining of the internal incisions are closed with 5-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The nose is irrigated and suctioned.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  Sponge and instrument count were complete at the end of the procedure.","surgery, rhinoplasty approach, debulking of hemangioma, nasal domes, lower lateral cartilages, nasal tip, columella, hemangioma, debulking, cartilages, rhinoplasty, nasal,"

The patient states that she was knocked over by her friend's dog.  She sustained a subcapital left hip fracture.  Prior to admission, she lived alone in Terrano, was ambulating with a walker.  All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were then discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained.,HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS: , A 28 mm medium head was used, a small cemented femoral stem was used, and a 28 x 46 cup was used.,PROCEDURE:  ,All risks, benefits, and potential complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  She was then transferred from the preoperative care unit to operating suite #1.  Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic without complications.,After this, the patient was transferred to the operating table and positioned.  All bony prominences were well padded.  She was positioned on a beanbag in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip facing upwards.  The left lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in the normal fashion.  A skin maker was then used to mark all bony prominences.  Skin incision was then carried out extending from the greater trochanter in a curvilinear fashion posteriorly across the buttocks.  A #10 blade Bard-Parker scalpel was used to incise the skin through to the subcutaneous tissues.  A second #10 blade was then used to incise through the subcutaneous tissue down to the fascia lata.  This was then incised utilizing Metzenbaum scissors.  This was taken down to the bursa, which was removed utilizing a rongeur.  Utilizing a periosteal elevator as well as the sponge, the fat was then freed from the short external rotators of the left hip after these were placed and stretched.  The sciatic nerve was then visualized and retracted utilizing a Richardson retractor.  Bovie was used to remove the short external rotators from the greater trochanter, which revealed the joint capsule.  The capsule was cleared and incised utilizing a T-shape incision.  A fracture hematoma was noted upon entering the joint capsule as well as subcapital hip fracture.  A cork screw was then used to remove the fractured femoral head, which was given to the scrub tech which was sized on the back table.  All bony remnants were then removed from the acetabulum and surrounding soft tissue with a rongeur.  Acetabulum was then inspected and found to be clear.  Attention was then turned to the proximal femur where a cutting tunnel was used to mark the femur for the femoral neck cut.  An oscillating saw was then used to make the femoral cut.  Box osteotome was then used to remove the bone from proximal femur.  A Charnley awl was then used to open the femoral canal, paying close attention to keep the awl in the lateral position.  Next, attention was turned to broaching.  Initially, a small broach was placed, first making efforts to lateralize the broach then the femoral canal.  It was felt that the patient has less benefit from a cemented prosthesis and a small size was appropriate.  Next, the trial components were inserted consisting of the above-mentioned component sizes.  The hip was taken through range of motion and tested to adduction, internal and external rotations as well as with a shuck and a posterior directed force on a flexed tip.  It was noted that these size were stable through the range of motion.  Next, the trial components were removed and the femoral canal was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried utilizing Super sucker and __________ then inserted pressuring the femoral canal.  The femoral component was then inserted and then held under pressure.  Extruding cement was removed from the proximal femur.  After the cement had fully hardened and dried, the head and cup were applied.  The hip was subsequently reduced and taken again through range of motion, which was felt to be stable.,Next, the capsule was closed utilizing #1 Ethibond in figure-of-eight fashion.  Next, the fascia lata was repaired utilizing a figure-of-eight Ethibond sutures.  The most proximal region at the musculotendinous junction was repaired utilizing a running #1 Vicryl suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated again to suction dry.  Next, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated using #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures.  The skin was then reapproximated utilizing skin clips.  Sterile dressing was applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs as well as foam tape.  The patient was then transferred from the operating table to the gurney.  Leg lengths were checked, which were noted to be equal and abduction pillow was placed.  The patient was then transferred to the Postoperative Care Unit in stable condition.","surgery, austin-moore bipolar hemiarthroplasty, subcapital left hip fracture, hip fracture, austin moore bipolar hemiarthroplasty, subcutaneous tissues, hip, hemiarthroplasty, austin, cemented, femur, subcapital, fracture, femoral,"

This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.,The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today.  She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.,She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe.  There is significant mass effect.  There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.,She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages.  However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team.  Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed.  The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.  Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly.  The scalp was resected anteriorly.  The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery.  The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.  The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.,The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.,The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected.  It was quite full.  The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur.  The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.,Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax.  The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.  This was left in place.,The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made.  Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain was quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It was quite vascular.  Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished.  No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected.  It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.  The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion.,She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly.

A 6-French arterial sheath was placed in the usual fashion.  Left and right coronary angiograms were then performed in various projections after heparin was given 2000 units intraaortic.  The right coronary artery was difficult to cannulate because of its high anterior takeoff.  This was nondominant.  Several catheters were used.  Ultimately, an AL1 diagnostic catheter was used.  A pigtail catheter was advanced across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculogram was then done in the RAO view using 30 mL of contrast.  Pullback gradient was obtained across the aortic valve.  Femoral angiogram was performed through the sheath which was above the bifurcation, was removed with a Perclose device with good results.  There were no complications.  He tolerated this procedure well and returned to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Right coronary artery:  This has an unusual high anterior takeoff.  The vessel is nondominant, has diffuse mild-to-moderate disease.,2.  Left main trunk:  A 30% to 40% distal narrowing is present.,3.  Left anterior descending:  Just at the ostium of the vessel and up to and including the bifurcation of the first large diagonal branch, there is 80 to 90% narrowing.  The diagonal is a large vessel about 3 mm in size.,4.  Circumflex:  Dominant vessel, 50% narrowing at the origin of the obtuse marginal.  After this, there is 40% narrowing in the AV trunk.  The small posterior lateral branch has diffuse mild disease and then the vessel gives rise to a fairly large posterior ventricular branch, which has 70% ostial narrowing, and then after this the posterior descending has 80% narrowing at its origin.,5.  Left ventriculogram:  Normal volume in diastole and systole.  Normal systolic function is present.  There is no mitral insufficiency or left ventricular outflow obstruction.,DIAGNOSES,1.  Severe complex left anterior descending and distal circumflex disease with borderline, probably moderate narrowing of a large obtuse marginal branch.  Dominant circumflex system.  Severe disease of the posterior descending.  Mild left main trunk disease.,2.  Normal left ventricular systolic function.,Given the complex anatomy of the predominant problem which is the left anterior descending; given its ostial stenosis and involvement of the bifurcation of the diagonal, would recommend coronary bypass surgery.  The patient also has severe disease of the circumflex which is dominant.  This anatomy is not appropriate for percutaneous intervention.  The case will be reviewed with a cardiac surgeon.","surgery, heart catheterization, coronary angiography, left ventriculography, arterial sheath, coronary artery, obtuse marginal branch, angiography, catheterization,"

The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma.  The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery.  The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length.  The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively.  She was given triple antibiotics IV.  Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed.,The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia.  Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline.  Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology.  Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.  A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis.  A patent anastomosis was palpated.  The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture.  Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia.  The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage.  Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter.  Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction.  Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia.  Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.,Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.,","surgery, colon tumor, ascites, adhesions, lysis of adhesions, exploratory laparotomy, colon cancer, transverse colon, hemicolectomy, laparotomy, "

He was positioned in the modified beach chair position on the operative table utilizing the shoulder apparatus.  The left shoulder and upper extremities were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A longitudinal incision was made extending from a point just lateral to the coracoid down towards deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.  This incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues were split utilizing the coag cautery.  Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery.  The deltoid fascia were identified, skin flaps were then created.  The deltopectoral interval was identified and the deltoid split just lateral to the cephalic vein.  The deltoid was then retracted.  There was marked hematoma and swelling within the subdeltoid bursa.  This area was removed with rongeurs.  The biceps tendon was identified which was the landmark for the rotator interval.  Mayo scissors was utilized to split the remaining portion of the rotator interval.  The greater tuberosity portion with the rotator cuff was identified.  Excess bone was removed from the greater tuberosity side to allow for closure later.  The lesser tuberosity portion with the subscapularis was still attached to the humeral head, therefore, osteotome was utilized to separate the lesser tuberosity from the humeral head fragment.,Excess bone was removed from the lesser tuberosity as well.  Both of these were tagged with Ethibond sutures for later.  The humeral head was delivered out of the wound.  It was localized to the area of the anteroinferior glenoid region.  The glenoid was then inspected, and noted to be intact.  The fracture was at the level of the surgical neck on the proximal humerus.  The canal was repaired with the broaches.  An #8 stem was chosen as it was going to be cemented into place.  The trial stem was impacted into position and the shaft of the bone marked with the cautery to the appropriate retroversion.  Trial reduction was performed.  The 48 x 21 mm head was the most appropriate size, matching the patient's as well as the soft tissue tension on the shoulder.  At this point, the wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution.  The canal was copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  Methyl methacrylate cement was mixed.  The cement gun was filled and the canal was filled with the cement.  The #8 stem was then impacted into place and held in the position in the appropriate retroversion until the cement had cured.  Excess cement was removed by sharp dissection.  Prior to cementation of the stem, a hole was drilled in the shaft of proximal humerus and #2 fiber wires were placed through this hole for closure later.  Once the cement was cured, the modular head was impacted on to the Morse taper.  It was stable and the shoulder was reduced.  The lesser tuberosity was then reapproximated back to the original site utilizing the #2 fiber wire suture that was placed in the humeral shaft as well as the holes in the humeral implant.  The greater tuberosity portion with rotator cuff was also attached to the implant as well as the shaft of the humerus utilizing #2 fiber wires as well.  The rotator interval was closed with #2 fiber wire in an interrupted fashion.  The biceps tendon was ________ within this closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution, suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was then approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous layer was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  Subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine solution.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound followed by application of a large arm sling.  Circulatory status was intact in the extremity at the completion of the case.  The patient was then transferred to recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.","surgery, dislocation, proximal humerus, comminuted fracture, rotator interval, tuberosity portion, hemiarthroplasty, fracture, wound, proximal, deltoid, rotator, stem, humeral, humerus, tuberosity, cemented,"

The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.

The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.

749," Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.", Surgery," Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 10 ","PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization, left and right coronary angiography, left ventricular angiography, and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the Catheterization Laboratory.  After informed consent, he was medicated with Versed and fentanyl.  The right groin was prepped and draped, and infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine.  Percutaneously, #6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography.  The patient had a totally occluded right coronary.  We initially started with a JR4 guide.  We were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis.  We were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated.  We then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis, but we had very little guide support, the guide kept coming out.  We then switched to an AL1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion.  We finally had to go an AL2 guide, we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection.  That guided seated, we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis, and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip.  The surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open, but we were able to re-cross with a sport wire.  We then re-dilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support, we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm Vision stent, where the lesion was and post-dilated it to 18 atmospheres.  Routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded, whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear, but we were able to re-wire that area and get a 25 x12 Vision balloon and dilate the area and re-establish flow to the small segment.  We then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm Vision stent at 18 atmospheres.  Final angiography showed resolution of the dissection.  We could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent.  No perforation and excellent flow.  During the intervention, we did give a bolus and drip of Angiomax.  At the end of the procedure, we stopped the Angiomax and gave 600 mg of Plavix.  We did a right femoral angiogram; however, the Angio-Seal plug could not take, so we used manual pressure and a Femostop.  We transported the patient to his room in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC DATA:,  Left main coronary is normal.  Left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60% stenosis of the LAD before it bifurcates into diagonal.  The diagonal does appear to have about 50% osteal stenosis.  There is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal, but good flow.  The rest of the LAD looked good pass the proximal 60% stenosis and after the diagonal branch.  Circumflex artery was nondominant vessel, consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel.  The first obtuse marginal had a long 50% narrowing and then the AV groove branch was free of any disease.  Some mild collaterals to the right were seen.  Right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary, just about 0.5 cm after its origin.  After we got a wire across the area of occlusion, we could see some thrombosis and a 99% stenosis just at the curve.  Following the balloon angioplasty, we established good flow down the distal vessel.  We still had about residual 70% stenosis.  When we had to go back with the AL2 guide, we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection.  We re-dilated and then deployed.  Repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally.  We never did have the wire that far down, so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus.  After deploying the stent, we had total resolution of the original lesion.  We then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch, which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large PDA.  The posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.  We got a wire through and dilated this.  We then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent.  Repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection, a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch, but this was excluded by the stent.  There were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow.  The distal posterolateral branch did open up, although it was little under-filled and there may have been some mild residual disease there.,IMPRESSION: , Atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary, successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection.  Minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60% proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50% diagonal stenosis along with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.","surgery, heart catheterization, coronary angiography, ventricular angiography, intercoronary stenting, intercoronary, coronary, stenting, stenosis, angiography"

The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding.  The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy.  Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished.  The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft.  Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent.  The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material.  All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time.  The left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.,The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery.

The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration.  He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods.  At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction.  The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone.  He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a ""floppy tail"" after the surgery and accepts the fact.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively.  The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial.  The wound's bases were fibrous.  They did not break the bone at this point.  They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter.  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection.,Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied.  Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium.  Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue.  A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered.  Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed.  Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis.  Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon.  The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy.  The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade.  Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint.  Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone.  Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx.  This bone was removed with a sharp dissection.  Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx.  This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology.  Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx.  Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins.  The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline.  Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin.  This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing.  The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue.  Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology.  Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed.  Six beads were placed in the wound.  Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique.,The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits.  A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact.  He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting.  He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice.  He is to follow up with Dr. X.  He was given emergency contact numbers.

The patient suffered neurologic devastation.  In order to facilitate enteral feedings, the plan is to place a G-tube as the patient cannot take by mouth.  Consent was obtained by court order as the patient is a ward of the state.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made through the umbilicus.  Peritoneal cavity entered bluntly.  A 5-mm trocar was introduced.  Abdomen was insufflated with a 5-mm scope.  No obvious pathology noted.  We visualized the stomach.  We chose the spot in the left upper quadrant for future G-tube site.  I made a small incision on the skin there, put another 5-mm trocar at that site.  Using a Babcock, we grasped the stomach along the greater curvature site for further G-tube.  I pulled a knuckle of stomach through the incision and secured with 4-0 Vicryl.  I then used 3-0 Prolene sutures as tacking sutures on either side of the future G-tube site taking full-thickness abdominal wall through stomach and back out the abdominal wall.  I then pulled the knuckle of stomach back up through the incision, made a gastrotomy, and then put a 4-0 pursestring around the gastrotomy site, introduced the 14, 1.2- cm MIC-Key into the stomach.  The gastrotomy site insufflated with 5 mL of saline.  We then tied down the pursestring.  On the laparoscopy, the G-tube looked to be in good position.  I insufflated the stomach through the G-tube, which I did and removed air subsequently.  I then placed 2 x 2 underneath the G-tube and tied down tacking sutures around the G-tube itself, placed the G-tube to gravity, desufflated the abdomen, closed the umbilical port site fascia with 3-0 Vicryl, closed skin with 5-0 Monocryl, and dressed with bacitracin, 2 x 2, and Steri-Strips.

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.

The patient has history of previous right foot infection requiring first ray resection.  The patient has ulcerations of right second toe dorsally at the proximal interphalangeal joint, which has failed to respond to conservative treatment.  The patient now has exposed bone and osteomyelitis in the second toe.  The patient has been on IV antibiotics as an outpatient and has failed to respond to these and presents today for surgical intervention.,After an IV was started by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  A restraint belt was placed around the patient's waist using copious amounts of Webril and an ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the patient's right ankle and the patient was made comfortable by the Department of Anesthesia.  After adequate amounts of sedation had been given to the patient, we administered a block of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain in proximal digital block around the second digit.  The foot and ankle were then prepped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was elevated and an Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was brought back onto the table.  Using Band-Aid scissors, the stockinet was cut and reflected and using a wet and dry sponge, the foot was wiped, cleaned, and the second toe identified.,Using a skin scrape, a racket type incision was planned around the second toe to allow also remodelling of previous operative site.  Using a fresh #10 blade, skin incision was made circumferentially in the racket-shaped manner around the second digit.  Then, using a fresh #15 blade, the incision was deepened and was taken down to the level of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.  Care was taken to identify bleeders and cautery was used as necessary for hemostasis.  After cleaning up all the soft tissue attachments, the second digit was disarticulated down to the level of the metatarsophalangeal joint.  The head of the second metatarsal was inspected and was noted to have good glistening white cartilage with no areas of erosion evident by visual examination.  Attention was then directed to closure of the wound.  All remaining tissue was noted to be healthy and granular in appearance with no necrotic tissue evident.  Areas of subcutaneous tissue were then removed through a sharp dissection in order to allow better approximation of the skin edges.  Due to long-standing lower extremity lymphedema and postoperative changes on previous surgery, I thought that we were unable to close the incision in entirety.  Therefore, after copious amounts of irrigation using sterile saline, it was determined to use modified dental rolls using #4-0 gauze to remove tension from the skin.  Deep vertical mattress sutures were used in order to reapproximate more closely, the skin edges and bring the plantar flap of skin up to the dorsal skin.  This was obtained using #2-0 nylon suture.  Following this, the remaining exposed tissue from the wound was covered using moist to dry saline soaked 4 x 4 gauze.  The wound was then dressed using 4 x 4 gauze fluffed with abdominal pads, then using Kling and Kerlix and an ACE bandage to provide compression.  The tourniquet was deflated at 42 minutes' time and hemostasis was noted to be achieved.  The ACE bandage was extended up to just below the knee and no bleeding striking to the bandages was appreciated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact, as was evidenced by capillary bleeding, which was present during the procedure.  Sedation was given postoperative introductions, which include to remain nonweightbearing to her right foot.  The patient was instructed to keep the foot elevated and to apply ice behind her knee as necessary, no more than 20 minutes each hour.  The patient was instructed to continue her regular medications.  The patient was to continue IV antibiotic course and was given prescription for Vicoprofen to be taken q.4h. p.r.n. for moderate to severe pain #30.  The patient will followup with Podiatry on Monday morning at 8:30 in the Podiatry Clinic for dressing change and evaluation of her foot at that time.,The patient was instructed as to signs and symptoms of infection, was instructed to return to the Emergency Department immediately if these should present.

The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable.  The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors.  At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm.  Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors.  The mucosa within the hernia was normal.  The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout.  The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion.  During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia.  It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter.  When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one.  No stretching of the mucosa took place.  The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Esophagitis.,2.

The foot was lowered into the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  Attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the foot where approximately a 5 mm long cicatrix was palpated and visualized.  This was the origin and entry point of the previous puncture wound from the wire.  This cicatrix was found lateral to the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal between the first and second metatarsals in a nonweightbearing area.  Next, the Xi-scan was draped and brought into the operating room.  A #25 gauge needles under fluoroscopy were inserted into the plantar aspect of the foot and three planes to triangulate the wire.  Next, a #10 blade was used to make approximately a 3 cm curvilinear ""S""-shaped incision.  Next, the #15 blade was used to carry the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  The medial and lateral margins of the incision were undermined.  Due to the small nature of the foreign body and the large amount of fat on the plantar aspect of the foot, the wires seemed to serve no benefit other then helping with the incision planning.  Therefore, they were removed.  Once the wound was opened, a hemostat was used to locate the wire very quickly and the wire was clamped.  A second hemostat was used to clamp the wire.  A #15 blade was used to carefully transect the fatty tissue around the tip of the hemostats, which were visualized in the base of the wound.  The wire quickly came into visualization.  It measured approximately 4 mm in length and was approximately 1 mm in diameter.  The wire was green colored and metallic in nature.  It was removed with the hemostat and passed off as a specimen to be sent to Pathology for identification.  The wire was found at the level of deep fascia at the capsular level just plantar to the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament.  Next, copious amounts of sterile gentamicin impregnated saline was instilled in the wound for irrigation and the wound base was thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to throw two simple interrupted deep sutures to remove the dead space.  Next, #4-0 Ethibond was used to close the skin in a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released.  There was immediate hyperemic flush to the digits noted.  The patient's anesthesia was reversed.  He tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  The patient was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.,Vital signs were stable and vascular status was intact to the right foot.  He was given OrthoWedge shoe.  Ice was applied behind the knee and his right lower extremity was elevated on to pillows.  He was given standard postoperative instructions consisting of rest, ice and elevation to the right lower extremity.  He is to be non-weightbearing for three weeks, at which time, the wound will be evaluated and sutures will be removed.  He is to follow up with Dr. X on 08/22/2003 and was given emergency contact number to call if problems arise.  He was given a prescription for Tylenol #4, #30 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain as well as Celebrex 200 mg #30 take two p.o. q.d. p.c., with 200 mg 12 hours later as a rescue dose.  He was given crutches.  He was discharged in stable condition.","surgery, foreign body removal, excision of foreign body, ankle tourniquet, plantar aspect, foreign body, foot, ankle, plantar, wound,"

He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics.  It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity.  After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body.,PROCEDURE: , After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient.  Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from.  At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads.  Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region.  Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain.  The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot.  There was no obvious joint involvement.  After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound.  The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue.  The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit.

The patient had asymmetry as well as right breast hypertrophy, and therefore, the procedures named above were indicated.  The patient was informed about the possible risks and complications of the above procedures and gave an informed consent.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operating room, placed supine on the operative table.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was established and IV prophylactic antibiotics were given, the chest and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.,Attention was first turned to the left breast where liposuction was performed laterally to allow for better contour and minimize the outer quadrant.  The incision was made for this and was then closed with 5-0 Prolene interrupted suture.,Attention was then turned to the right breast where liposuction was also performed to reduce the medial superior and lateral quadrants.  Once this was performed, the vertical reduction mammoplasty was outlined.  Prior to that, the nipple reconstruction was performed with a keyhole pattern flap.  The flap was elevated with 15-blade and hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie.  The flap was then sutured onto itself and secured with 5-0 Prolene interrupted sutures.  Then the lateral and medial limbs were undermined to close the defect and this was performed with 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures.  Subsequently, the reduction mastectomy skin was then excised sharply and passed up the table marked and sent to Pathology. ,Hemostasis was then obtained with the Bovie and then undermining was performed in the medial, superior, and lateral skin to allow for closure of the reduction incisions.  Once this was performed, a 3-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures were used to close the inferior limb.  Subsequently 2-0 PDS continuous suture was then placed in the periareolar area to close the defect, with a diameter that equaled the new nipple areolar complex.  Once this was performed, the remaining incision was then closed with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Subsequently, the 2 lesions were excised, the larger one which was medial and the lateral one that was smaller that were excised sharply, passed up the table and sent to Pathology.  They were closed in 2 layers using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the abdominal scars where liposuction and tumescent solution of diluted epinephrine were used to minimize the amount of excision that was required.  Subsequently the extra skin was excised sharply in an elliptical fashion on the right side measuring approximately 10 x 3 cm, this was the superior and inferior skin, was when undermined and closure was performed after hemostasis was obtained with 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.,Attention was then turned to the contralateral left side where there was a larger defect.  There was a larger excision required measuring approximately 15 x 3 cm.  The superior and inferior edges of skin were undermined and closed primarily using 3-0 Monocryl followed by 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips were placed on all incisions followed by surgical bra.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without complications and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.

Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.  However, the above was reviewed with the patient in great detail as well as with her daughter and mother who were at the bedsite at this time as well.","surgery, carcinomatosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy, lavage, brushings, endobronchial mucosal biopsies, mucosal, bronchoscope, atrovent, topical, fiberoptic, hemoptysis, bronchoscopy, endobronchial, oropharynx"

The patient recently underwent a fistulogram with angioplasty at the proximal upper arm cephalic vein due to a stenosis detected on Duplex ultrasound.  The patient subsequently was noted to have poor flow to the fistula, and the fistula was difficult to palpate.  A repeat ultrasound was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis involving the distal upper arm cephalic vein just distal to the brachial anastomosis.  The patient presents today for a left arm fistulogram with angioplasty.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient and understands and in agreement to proceed.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was brought to the angio suite and laid supine on the table.  After sedation was administered, the left arm was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring were performed throughout the procedure.  The patient was given 1 g of IV Ancef prior to incision.,The left brachiocephalic fistula was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The cephalic vein in the proximal upper arm region appeared to be of adequate caliber.  There was an area of stenosis at the proximal cephalic vein just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The cephalic vein in the proximal forearm region was easily compressible.  The skin overlying the vessel was injected with 1% lidocaine solution.  A small incision was made with the #11 blade.  The cephalic vein then was cannulated with a 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath.  The sheath was advanced over the wire.  A fistulogram was performed which demonstrated a high-grade stenosis just distal to the brachial artery anastomosis.  The introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath over a 0.025 guide wire.  The sheath was aspirated and flushed with heparinized saline solution.  A 0.025 glidewire was then obtained and advanced, placed over the sheath and across the area of stenosis into the brachial artery.  A 5 French short Kumpe catheter was used to guide the wire into the distal brachial and radial artery.  After crossing the area of stenosis, a 5 x 20 mm standard angioplasty balloon was obtained and prepped from the back table.  This was placed over the glidewire into the area of stenosis and inflated to 14 mmHg pressure and then deflated.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated significant improvement.  However, there is still a remainder of residual stenosis.  The 5-mm balloon was placed over the wire again and a repeat angioplasty was performed.  The balloon was then removed over the wire and a repeat angiogram was performed which demonstrated again an area of stenosis right at the anastomosis.  The glidewire was removed and a 0.014 guide wire was then obtained and placed through the sheath and across the brachial anastomosis and into the radial artery.  A 4 x 20 mm cutting balloon was obtained and prepped on the back table.  The 5 French sheath was then exchanged for a 6 French sheath.  The balloon was then placed over the 0.014 guide wire into the area of stenosis and then inflated to normal pressures at 8 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and removed over the wire.  A 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was obtained and prepped and placed over the wire into the area of stenosis and inflated to pressures of 14 mmHg.  A repeat fistulogram was performed after the removal of the balloon which demonstrated excellent results with no significant residual stenosis.  The patient actually had a nice palpable thrill at this point.  The fistulogram of the distal cephalic vein at the subclavian anastomosis was performed which demonstrated a mild area of stenosis.  The sheath was removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.,After hemostasis was achieved, the cephalic vein again was visualized with bevel ultrasound.  The proximal cephalic vein was then cannulated after injecting the skin overlying the vessel with a 1% lidocaine solution.  A 5 French micropuncture introducer sheath was then placed over the wire into the proximal cephalic vein.  A repeat fistulogram was performed which demonstrated an area of stenosis within the distal cephalic vein just prior to the subclavian vein confluence.  The 5 French introducer sheath was then exchanged for a 5 French sheath.  The 5 mm x 20 mm balloon was placed over a 0.035 glidewire across the area of stenosis.  The balloon was inflated to 14 mmHg.  The balloon was then deflated and a repeat fistulogram was performed through the sheath which demonstrated good results.  The sheath was then removed and blood pressure was held over the puncture site for approximately 10 minutes.  After adequate hemostasis was achieved, the area was cleansed in 2x2 and Tegaderm was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.  I was present for the entire case.  The sponge, instrument, and needle counts are correct at the end of the case.  The patient was subsequently taken to PACU in stable condition.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,  The initial left arm brachiocephalic fistulogram demonstrated a stenosis at the brachial artery anastomosis and distally within the cephalic vein.  After standard balloon angioplasty, there was a mild improvement but some residual area of stenosis remained at the anastomosis.  Then postcutting balloon angioplasty, venogram demonstrated a significant improvement without any evidence of significant stenosis.,Fistulogram of the proximal cephalic vein demonstrated a stenosis just prior to the confluence with the left subclavian vein.  Postangioplasty demonstrated excellent results with the standard balloon.  There was no evidence of any contrast extravasation.,IMPRESSION,1.

Due to her prior history, it was felt that she would benefit from diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy to help determine the etiology of the hemoptysis.  She was brought to endoscopy suite #4 and informed consent was obtained.  ,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient was placed in the supine position and intubated by the Anesthesia Service.  Intravenous sedation was given as per Anesthesia.  The fiberoptic scope was passed through the #8 endotracheal tube into the main trachea.  The right mainstem bronchus was examined.  The right upper lobe and subsegments appeared grossly within normal limits with no endobronchial lesions noted.  Upon examining the right middle lobe, there was a tumor noted occluding the lateral segment of the right middle lobe and a clot appreciated over the medial segment of the right middle lobe.,The clot was lavaged with normal saline and there was noted to be tumor behind this clot.  Tumor completely occluded both segments of the right middle lobe.  Scope was then passed to the subsegments of the right lower lobe, which were individually examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions.  Scope was pulled back to the level of the midtrachea, passed into the left mainstem bronchus.  Left upper lobe and its subsegments were examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions.  The lingula and left lower subsegments were all each individually examined and noted to be grossly free of endobronchial lesions.  There were some secretions noted throughout the left lung.  The scope was retracted and passed again to the right mainstem bronchus.  The area of the right middle lobe was reexamined.  The tumor was noted to be grossly friable with oozing noted from the tumor with minimal manipulation.  It did not appear as if a scope or cannula could be passed distal to the tumor.  Due to continued oozing, 1 cc of epinephrine was applied topically with adequate hemostasis obtained.  The area was examined for approximately one minute for assurance of adequate hemostasis.  The scope was then retracted and the patient was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will be extubated as per the Anesthesia Service.

Oral surgery was consulted to evaluate the patient.,After evaluation of the facial CT with tracheal deviation and abscess in the left muscular space, it was determined that the patient needed to be taken urgently to the operating room under general anesthesia and have the abscess incision and drainage and removal of tooth #17.  Risks, benefits, alternatives, treatments were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  The patient was transported to operating room #4 at Clinic.  He was laid supine on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetics and maintained with oral endotracheal intubation and inhalation of anesthetics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral and maxillofacial surgery fashion.,The surgeon approached the operating room table in sterile fashion.  Approximately 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left submandibular area in the area of the incision.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, an 18-gauge needle was introduced into the left masticator space and approximately 5 mL of pus was removed.  This was sent for aerobic and anaerobic micro.  Using a 15-blade, a 2-cm incision was made in the left submandibular region, then a hemostat was introduced in blunt dissection into the medial border of the mandible was performed.  The left masticator space was thoroughly explored as well as the left submandibular space and submental space.  Pus was drained from this site.  Copious amounts of sterile fluid were irrigated into the site.,Attention was then directed intraorally where a moistened Ray-Tec sponge was placed in the posterior oropharynx to act as a throat pack.  Approximately 4 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine were injected into the left inferior alveolar nerve block.  Using a 15-blade, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was developed around tooth #17.  The tooth was elevated and delivered, and the lingual area of tooth #17 was explored and more pus was expressed.  This pus was evacuated intraorally __________ suction.  The extraction site and the left masticator space were irrigated, and it was noted that the irrigation was communicating with extraoral incision in the neck.,A 0.25-inch Penrose drain was placed in the lingual aspect of the mandible extraorally through the neck and secured with 2-0 silk suture.  A tack stitch intraorally with 3-0 chromic suture was placed.  The throat pack was then removed.  An orogastric tube was placed and removed all other stomach contents and then removed.

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",

The patient subjectively had loss of consciousness on the scene and minimal bleeding from the left supraorbital laceration site.  He was brought to the Emergency Room, where a CAT scan of the head and facial bumps was performed, which were negative.,Prior to performing surgery informed consent was obtained from the patient who was well aware of the risks, benefits, alternatives and complications of the surgery to include infection, bleeding, cosmetic deformity, significant scarring, need for possible scar revision.  The patient was allowed to ask all questions he wanted, and they were answered in a language he could understand.  He wished to pursue surgery and signed the informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position.  The wound was copiously irrigated with normal saline on irrigating tip.  After one liter of irrigation, the wound was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The incision was then localized with a solution of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, a total of less than 2 cc was used.  We then reapproximated the wound in double-layered fashion with deep sutures of #5-0 Vicryl, two interrupted sutures were used, and then the skin was closed with interrupted sutures of #5-0 nylon.

He was anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen was sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.  An eye patch was placed on the right side, and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to PACU in good condition.","surgery, frozen section, full-thickness skin grafting, squamous cell carcinoma, eyelid, orbicularis,"

The large and small bowels were completely enveloping a large right ovarian cystic mass.  Normal anatomy was difficult to see due to adhesions.  Cyst was ruptured incidentally intraoperatively with approximately 150 mL to 200 mL of turbid fluid.  Cyst wall, tube, and ovary were stripped away from the bowel.  Posterior peritoneum was also removed in order to completely remove the cyst wall ovary and tube.  There was excellent postoperative hemostasis.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, where general anesthesia was achieved without difficulty.  She was then placed in a dorsal supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A vertical midline incision was made from the umbilicus and extended to the symphysis pubis along the line of the patient's prior incision.  Incision was carried down carefully until the peritoneal cavity was reached.  Care was taken upon entry of the peritoneum to avoid injury of underlying structures.  At this point, the extensive adhesive disease was noted, again requiring greater than 45 minutes of dissection in order to visualize the intended anatomy for surgery.  The omentum was carefully stripped away from the patient's right side developing a window.  This was extended down along the inferior portion of the incision removing the omentum from its adhesions to the anterior peritoneum and what appears to be the vesicouterine peritoneum.  A large mass of bowel was noted to be adherent to itself causing a quite tortuous course.  Adhesiolysis was performed in order to free up the bowel in order to pack it out of the pelvis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was then packed over of the pelvis allowing visualization of a matted mass of large and small bowel surrounding a large ovarian cyst.  Careful adhesive lysis and dissection enabled the colon to be separated from the posterior wall of the cyst.  Small bowel and portion of the colon were adherent anteriorly on the cyst and during the dissection of these to remove them from their attachment, the cyst was ruptured.  Large amount of turbid fluid was noted and was evacuated.  The cyst wall was then carefully placed under tension and stripped away from the patient's small and large bowel.  Once the bowel was freed, the remnants of round ligament was identified, elevated, and the peritoneum was incised opening the retroperitoneal space.,The retroperitoneal space was opened following the line of the ovarian vessels, which were identified and elevated and a window made inferior to the ovarian vessels, but superior to the course of the ureter.  This pedicle was doubly clamped, transected, and tied with a free tie of #2-0 Vicryl.  A suture ligature of #0 Vicryl was used to obtain hemostasis.  Excellent hemostasis was noted at this pedicle.  The posterior peritoneum and portion of the remaining broad ligament were carefully dissected and shelled out to remove the tube and ovary, which was still densely adherent to the peritoneum.  Care was taken at the side of the remnant of the uterine vessels.  However, a laceration of the uterine vessels did occur, which was clamped with a right-angle clamp, and carefully sutured ligated with excellent hemostasis noted.  Remainder of the specimen was then shelled out including portions of the posterior and sidewall peritoneum and removed.,The opposite tube and ovary were identified, were also matted behind a large amount of large bowel and completely enveloped and wrapped in the fallopian tube.  Minimal dissection was performed in order to ascertain and ensure that the ovary appeared completely normal.  It was then left in situ.  Hemostasis was achieved in the pelvis with the use of electrocautery.  The abdomen and pelvis were copiously irrigated with warm saline solution.

Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.,The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.

The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.,Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  ,Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place.

Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.","surgery, endotracheal intubation, acute bowel obstruction, umbilical hernia, exploratory laparotomy, release of small bowel obstruction, repair of periumbilical hernia, incarcerated umbilical hernia, incarcerated, bowel, hernia, exploratory, laparotomy, abdomen, umbilical, obstruction, "

Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures.

Bilateral nasal polypectomy.,5.  Right middle turbinate reduction.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS:,  Approximately 50 cc.,INDICATION: , This is a 48-year-old female with a history of chronic sinusitis as well as nasal polyposis that have been refractory to outpatient medical management.  She has underwent sinus surgery in the past approximately 12 years ago with the CT evaluation revealed evidence of chronic mucosal thickening within the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses as well as the presence of polyposis within the nasal cavities bilaterally.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the operative suite where she was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was rotated 90 degrees away where cotton pledgets saturated with 4 cc of 10% cocaine solution were inserted into the nasal cavity.  The nasal septum, as well as the turbinates were then localized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed first to the left nasal cavity.  A zero-degree sinus endoscope was inserted into the nasal cavity down to the level of the nasopharynx.  The initial examination revealed a gross polypoid disease emanating from the sphenoid sinuses as well as off the supreme turbinate.  There was also polypoid disease present within the left middle meatus.  Nasopharynx was visualized with a patent eustachian tube.  At this point, the XPS micro debrider was used to take down all the polyps emanating from the inferior surface of the left middle turbinate as well as from the supreme turbinate.  The ostium to the sphenoid sinus was visualized and was not entered.  At this point, the left middle turbinate was localized and then medialized with the use of a freer elevator.  A ball-tip probe was then used to localize the openings for the natural maxillary ostium.  Side-biting forceps were used to take down the uncinate process and was further taken down with the use of the microdebrider.  The opening of the maxillary sinus was visualized.  The posterior fontanelle was taken down with the use of straight line forceps.  It should be mentioned that tissue was very thick and polypoid with chronic inflammatory changes evident.  The maxillary sinus ostia was then suctioned with Olive-tip suction and maxillary wash was performed.  The remainder of the anterior ethmoid was then cleaned again removing excess polypoid tissue.  The basal lamella was visualized and the posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered with use of the microdebrider as the surgical assistant palpated the patient's eyes for any vibration.  All polypoid tissue was collected in the microdebrider and sent as a surgical specimen.  Once all polypoid tissue has been removed, the cocaine pledgets were reinserted into the ethmoid air cells for hemostatic purposes.  Attention was then directed to the right nasal cavity.  Again, a sinus endoscope was inserted.  Inspection revealed a grossly hypertrophied turbinate.  It was felt that this enlarged and polypoid turbinate was contributing the patient's symptoms.  Therefore, the turbinate was localized and a hemostat was used to crush the mid portion of the turbinate, which was then resected with use of side-biting scissors as well the Takahashi forceps.  Sinus endoscope was then inserted all the way down through the nasopharynx.  Again, the eustachian tube was visualized without any obstructing lesions or masses.  Upon retraction, there was again polypoid tissue noted within the ethmoid sinuses.  The ball-tip probe was again used to locate the right maxillary ostium.  The side-biting forceps was used further take down the uncinate process.  The maxillary ostium was then widened with use of a XPS microdebrider.  A maxillary sinus wash was then performed.  Now, the attention was directed to the ethmoid air cells.  It should be mentioned again that the tissue of the anterior ethmoid was very thickened and polypoid.  This was again taken down with the use of XPS microdebrider while the surgical assistant carefully palpated the patient's eye.,Once all polypoid tissue have been removed, some bleeding that was encountered was controlled with the use of suction cautery in a very conservative manner.  Once all bleeding has been controlled, all surgical instruments were removed and Merocel packing was placed in the bilateral nasal cavities with the intent to remove in the recovery room.  At this point, the procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room without incident.","surgery, endoscopic sinus surgery, maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, nasal polypectomy, turbinate reduction, sinus surgery, sinus endoscope, maxillary sinus, nasal cavity, polypoid tissue, sinus, maxillary, turbinate, polypoid, nasal, total, ostium, microdebrider,"

The patient has progressive cholestatic jaundice and is on the liver transplant list at ABCD.  The patient is fed by mouth and also with nasogastric enteral feeding supplements.  She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month.  She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted.  Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month.  She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal.  I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time.  Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location.  There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive.  The coin actually came out with relative ease after which endoscopically identified.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had induction of general anesthesia.  She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications.  After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism.  A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view.  This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen.  At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps.  I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no intraoperative complications.  There was only one single coin noted, and she was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","surgery, portoenterostomy, foreign body removal, proximal esophagus, coin, esophagoscopy, esophageal, esophagus,"

Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 5 mL.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.,IMPRESSION: , Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.,PLAN:  ,Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.","surgery, olympus gif-160, pcf-160, endoscopy, crohn's disease, aphthous ulcers, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscope, esophagus, duodenum, mucosal, stomach, biopsies, colonoscopy"

The patient was prepped in the left lateral position.  IV sedation was given to a total of fentanyl 100 mcg and midazolam 4 mg for the initial EGD.  An additional 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam were given following erythromycin.  Scope tip of the Olympus gastroscope was passed into the esophagus.  Proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the esophagus were well visualized.  There was fresh blood in the esophagus, which was washed thoroughly, but no source was seen.  No evidence of varices was seen.  The stomach was entered.  The stomach was filled with very large clot and fresh blood and liquid, which could not be suctioned due to the clot burden.  There was a small amount of bright red blood near the fundus, but a source could not be identified due to the clot burden.  Because of this, the gastroscope was withdrawn.  The patient was given 250 mg of erythromycin in the Emergency Department and 30 minutes later, the scope was repassed.  On the second look, the esophagus was cleared.  The liquid gastric contents were cleared.  There was still a moderate amount of clot burden in the stomach, but no active bleeding was seen.  There was a small grade I esophageal varices, but no stigmata of bleed.  There was also a small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia, but no source of bleeding was identified.

Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition.","surgery, ivor-lewis, esophagogastrectomy, jejunostomy, thoracotomy, dual-lumen tube, chest tubes, bovie electrocautery, chest, endotracheal, electrocautery, abdomen, gastric, esophagus, tubes, vicryl, stomach, "

Imaging in the Emergency Department did demonstrate an esophageal foreign body at or above the level of the cricopharyngeus.  Due to this, the patient was consented and taken urgently to the operating room for removal of this foreign body.,OPERATIVE DETAILS:,  The patient was correctly identified in the preop holding area and brought to operating room #37.  After informed consent was reviewed, general anesthesia was induced, initially with propofol, the existing IV.  Following this after protective eye tape was placed, #9 Parson's laryngoscope was introduced transorally and used to perform a direct laryngoscopy.  Normal anatomy was visualized.  Following this, a 4-mm, 20-rigid endoscope was introduced through the Parson's laryngoscope and used to perform a direct tracheoscopy.  The patient's supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis down to the level of the mid trachea were found to be benign with no abnormal-appearing anatomy.  Following this, the rigid endoscope was removed and the patient was intubated with a 4-0 endotracheal tube cuffed without difficulty.  After confirming bilateral breath sounds and positive end tidal CO2, this was secured to the patient by the anesthesia staff.  Following this, the Parson's laryngoscope was removed and a size 4 rigid esophagoscope was inserted transorally and passed down to the level of the patient's cricopharyngeus were the foreign body was visualized.  At this point, the coin grasper device was connected to the camera system and inserted through the existing esophagoscope.  This was used to grasp the coin and the coin was removed under direct visualization and handed off as a separate specimen.  Following this, the 34 mm 0-degree scope was inserted through the esophagoscope once the esophagoscope was passed down to the patient's GE junction.  The entire esophageal mucosa was examined as the esophagoscope was backed out and there was only a minimal amount of superficial ulceration in the posterior wall of the esophagus near the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle.

The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2.

He has previously undergone total burn excision with placement of Integra and an initial round of epidermal autografting to the bilateral upper extremities and hands.  His donor sites have healed particularly over his buttocks and he returns for a second round of epidermal autografting over the Integra on his back utilizing the buttock donor sites, the extent they will provide coverage.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:,1.  Variable take of Integra, particularly centrally and inferiorly on the back.  A fair amount of lost Integra over the upper back and shoulders.,2.  No evidence of infection.,3.  Healthy viable wound beds prior to grafting.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  The patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine.  General endotracheal anesthesia was uneventfully induced and an appropriate time out was performed.  He was then repositioned prone and perioperative IV antibiotics were administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  All staples were removed from the Integra and the adherent areas of Silastic were removed.  The entire wound bed was further prepped with scrub brushes and more Betadine followed by a sulfamylon solution.  Hemostasis of the wound bed was ensured using epinephrine-soaked Telfa pads.  Following dermal tumescence of the buttocks, epidermal autografts were harvested 8 one-thousandths of an inch using the air Zimmer dermatome.  These grafts were passed to the back table where they were meshed 3:1.  The donor sites were hemostased using epinephrine-soaked Telfa and lap pads.  Once all the  grafts were meshed, we brought them back up onto the field, positioned them over the wounds beginning inferiorly and moving cephalad where we had best areas of Integra engraftment.  We were happy with the lie of the grafts and they were stapled into place.  The grafts were then overlaid with Conformant 2, which was also stapled into place.  Utilizing all of his buttocks skin, we did not have enough to cover his entire back, so we elected to apply allograft to the cephalad and a few areas on his flanks where we had had poor Integra engraftment.  Allograft was thawed and meshed 1:1.  It was then brought up onto the field, trimmed to fit and stapled into place over the wound.  Once the entirety of the posterior wounds on his back were covered out with epidermal autograft or allograft sulfamylon soaked dressings were applied.  Donor sites on his buttocks were dressed in Acticoat and secured with staples.  He was then repositioned supine and extubated in the operating room having tolerated the procedure without any apparent complications.

She was then transferred to Beaumont Hospital, at which point, she developed a sternal abscess.  The patient was treated for the abscess in Beaumont and then subsequently transferred to some other type of facility near her home in Warren, Michigan at which point, she developed a second what was termed minor myocardial infarction.,The patient subsequently recovered in a Cardiac Rehab Facility and approximately two weeks later, brings us to the month of August, at which time she was at home ambulating with a walker or a cane, and then sustained a fall and at that point she was unable to walk and had acute progressive weakness and was identified as having a central cord syndrome based on an MRI, which showed record signal change.  The patient underwent cervical laminectomy and seemed to be improving subjectively in terms of neurologic recovery, but objectively there was not much improvement.  Approximately 10 days after the surgery, brings us to today's date, the health officer was notified of the patient's labored breathing.  When she examined the patient, she also noted that the patient was unable to move her extremities.  She was concerned and called the Orthopedic resident who identified the patient to be truly quadriplegic.  I was notified and ordered the operative crew to report immediately and recommended emergent decompression for the possibility of an epidural hematoma.  On clinical examination, there was swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck.  The patient has no active movement in the upper and lower extremity muscle groups.  Reflexes are absent in the upper and lower extremities.  Long track signs are absent.  Sensory level is at the C4 dermatome.  Rectal tone is absent.  I discussed the findings with the patient and also the daughter.  We discussed the possibility of this is permanent quadriplegia, but at this time, the compression of the epidural space was warranted and certainly for exploration reasons be sure that there is a hematoma there and they have agreed to proceed with surgery.  They are aware that it is possible she had known permanent neurologic status regardless of my intervention and they have agreed to accept this and has signed the consent form for surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to OR #1 at ABCD General Hospital on a gurney.  Department of Anesthesia administered fiberoptic intubation and general anesthetic.  A Foley catheter was placed in the bladder.  The patient was log rolled in a prone position on the Jackson table.  Bony prominences were well padded.  The patient's head was placed in the prone view anesthesia head holder.  At this point, the wound was examined closely and there was hematoma at the caudal pole of the wound.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previous skin incision was reopened.  At this point, hematoma properly exits from the wound.  All sutures were removed and the epidural spaces were encountered at this time.  The self-retaining retractors were placed in the depth of the wound.  Consolidated hematoma was now removed from the wound.  Next, the epidural space was encountered.  There was no additional hematoma in the epidural space or on the thecal sac.  A curette was carefully used to scrape along the thecal sac and there was no film or lining covering the sac.  The inferior edge of the C2 lamina was explored and there was no compression at this level and the superior lamina of T1 was explored and again no compression was identified at this area as well.  Next, the wound was irrigated copiously with one liter of saline using a syringe.  The walls of the wound were explored.  There was no active bleeding.  Retractors were removed at this time and even without pressure on the musculature, there was no active bleeding.  A #19 French Hemovac drain was passed percutaneously at this point and placed into the epidural space.  Fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissue with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-Strips covered the incision and dressing was then applied over the incision.  The patient was then log rolled in the supine position on the hospital gurney.  She remained intubated for airway precautions and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  Once in the recovery room, she was alert.  She was following simple commands and using her head to nod, but she did not have any active movement of her upper or lower extremities.  Prognosis for this patient is guarded.","surgery, epidural hematoma, cervical spine, cervical laminectomy, central cord syndrome, acute quadriplegia, insertion of epidural drain, epidural drain, epidural space, hematoma, epidural, cervical, laminectomy, quadriplegia, "

A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair.  We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm.  The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off.  Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side.  We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area.  It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.,Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally.  The patient was then heparinized.,The 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally.,A stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side.  The calibrated aortogram was the done.  We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries.  We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries.,Once the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery.  As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely.,Following completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately.  A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries.  The area was ballooned aggressively.  It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above.,Following completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas.  Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique.  Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin.,Both surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly.  Meticulous hemostasis was achieved.

The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mm/Hg.  Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray.  A transverse incision was made in the wrist, between FCR and FCU, one fingerbreadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin.  Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A distal-based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned.  Care was taken to protect the underlying contents.  A proximal forearm fasciotomy was performed under direct vision.  A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface.  Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the hook of hamate.  The endoscopic instrument was then inserted into the proximal incision.  The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal.  Using palmar pressure, the transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end.,The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window.  The blade was then elevated, and the endoscopic instrument was withdrawn, dividing the transverse carpal ligament under direct vision.  After complete division o the transverse carpal ligament, the instrument was reinserted.  Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified, and complete release was confirmed.,The wound was then closed with running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied, and sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-Strips.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the Recovery Room in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.,DE QUERVAIN'S RELEASE: , With the patient under adequate regional anesthesia applied by surgeon using 1% plain Xylocaine, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  A transverse incision was then made over the radial aspect of the wrist overlying the first dorsal tunnel.  Using blunt dissection, the radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  The first dorsal tunnel was then identified.  The first dorsal tunnel was incised along the dorsal ulnar border, completely freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (de Quervain's release).  EPB and APL tendons were inspected and found to be completely free.  The radial sensory nerve was inspected and found to be without damage.,The skin was closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch and Steri-Strips were applied and, over the Steri-Strips, a sterile dressing, and, over the sterile dressing, a volar splint with the hand in safe position.

She also has a septal deviation mid posterior to the left compromising greater than 70% of her nasal airway.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the skin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the region of the anterior portion of the nasal septum.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.,A #15 blade and the Freer elevator were used to help make a standard hemitransfixion incision.  A mucoperichondrial flap was carefully elevated, and the junction with the cartilaginous bony septum was separated with the Freer elevator.  The bony deflection was removed using Jansen-Middleton forceps.  The cartilaginous deflection was created by freeing up the inferior attachments to the cartilaginous septum, placing it more on the midline maxillary crest.  The initial incision was placed in its anatomical position and secured with a 4-0 nylon suture for stabilization effect.,Attention then was directed toward the left side.  Lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected in the region of the anterior portion of the left middle turbinate and uncinate process and polyps.  Approximately 10 cc total was used.  The polyps were removed using the Richards essential shaver to help identify the middle turbinate and uncinate process better.  The uncinate process was removed systematically superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting forceps.  Next, the maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting forceps and showed polypoid accumulation in the mucosal disease on its opening site.  The sinus linings were edematous but did not have any polyps in the inferior, lateral, or superior aspects.,The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were entered primarily and dissected with the Richards essential shaver followed by the use of a 30-degree endoscope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral dissection.  Bright mucosal disease and small polypoid accumulations were noted through the sinuses also.  The inferior turbinates had some polypoid changes on them also and showed marked mucosal irritation and hypertrophy.  The mucosal polypoid accumulations were cleared using the Richards essential shaver.  The turbinate was partially resected from mucosally but with good shape to it.  It was not desirable to remove it in its entirety.  Any obvious bleeding points along the edge were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.,The same procedure and findings were noted on the right side with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine injected into the anterior portion of the right middle turbinate, polyps, and uncinate process; 10 cc total were used.  The polyps were removed.  The Richards essential shaver was used to allow better exposure of the uncinate process.  The uncinate process was removed superiorly to inferiorly with back-biting side-biting forceps.,Next, a maxillary antrostomy was identified and expanded with the back-biting and side-biting forceps and showed all plate accumulations there also.  The anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells were then entered primarily and dissected with Richards essential shaver followed by the use of the 30-degree scope and up-biting forceps for the superior and lateral resection.  The inferior turbinates showed mucosal disease, polypoid accumulations, and changes.  These were removed using the Richards essential shaver followed by a submucosal resection of the hypertrophied portion of the turbinate.,Any obvious bleeding points were controlled with the suction Bovie apparatus.  A thorough irrigation was then carried out in the nasal cavity, and Gelfilm packing was used to coat the linings in the middle meatal regions.

The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient's left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  Using fluoroscopy, the patient's K-wire was located.  An incision was made over his previous scar.  A subcutaneous dissection then took place in the plane between the subcutaneous fat and muscles.  The K-wires were easily palpable.  A small incision was made into the triceps, which allowed for visualization of the two pins, which were removed without incident.  The wound was then irrigated.  The triceps split was now closed using #2-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissue was also closed using #2-0 Vicryl and the skin with #4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s, as well as bias.  A total of 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision, as well as the joint line.  At the beginning of the case, prior to removal of the hardware, the arm was taken through some strenuous manipulations with improvement of his extension to 20 degrees, flexion to 130 degrees and pronation supination to about 40 degrees.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  ,The postoperative films demonstrated no fracture, no retained hardware.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will restart physical therapy and Dynasplint in 3 days.  The patient is to follow up in 1 week's time for a wound check.

She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening.  She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.,PROCEDURE: , After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.,DISPOSITION:  ,The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.  She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor.  Previous orders will be resumed.  We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings.","surgery, protein-calorie malnutrition, nausea, vomiting, peg tube placement, russell technique, peg tube, egd, protein, dysphagia, malnutrition, enterogastritis"

The left ear laceration deformity was very close to the bottom of her ear and therefore it was transected through the centrifugal edge of the ear lobe and pared.  The marsupialized epithelialized tracts were pared to raw tissue.  They were pared in a fashion to create a Y-V plasty with de-epithelialization of the distal V and overlap of the undermined from the proximal cephalad edge.  The 5-0 chromic sutures were used to approximate anteriorly, posteriorly, and anterior centrifugal edge in the Y-V plasty fashion to decrease the risk of notching.  Bacitracin, Band-Aid was placed.  Next, attention was turned to the contralateral ear where an elongated laceration deformity was pared of the marsupialized epithelialized edges anteriorly, posteriorly to create raw edges.  This was not taken through the edge of the lobe to decrease the risk of notch deformity.  The laceration was repaired anteriorly and posteriorly in a pleated fashion to decrease length of the incision and to decrease any deformity toward the edge or any dog-ear deformity toward the edge.  The 5-0 chromic sutures were used in interrupted fashion for this.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Band-Aid and bacitracin were placed.  She left the operating room in stable condition.","surgery, bilateral ear laceration, dog-ear deformity, ear laceration deformity, band aid, laceration deformity, ear laceration, laceration, deformity, ear, repair "

Preoperative imaging was performed in consultation with regard to aesthetic results and communicated via the computerized imager.  The patient had questions asked and answered.  Informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position.  The appropriate level of general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was converted to the lounge chair position, and the nose was anesthetized and vasoconstricted in the usual fashion.  Procedure began with an inverted going incision and elevation of the skin of the nose in the submucoperichondrial plane over the medial crural footplates and lower lateral cartilages and up over the dorsum.  The septal angle was approached and submucoperichondrial flaps were elevated.  Severe nasal septal deviation to the right hand side and evidence of an old fracture with a separate alignment of the cartilaginous nose from the bony nose was encountered.  The upper laterals were divided and medial and lateral osteotomies were carried out.  Inadequate septal cartilage was noted to be present for use as spreader graft; therefore, left postauricular incision was made, and the conchal bowl cartilage graft was harvested, and it was closed with 3-0 running locking chromic with a sterile cotton ball pressure dressing applied.  Ear cartilage graft was then placed to put two spreader grafts on the left and one the right.  The two on the left extended all the way up to the caudal tip, the one on the right just primarily the medial wall.  It was placed in such a way to correct a caudal dorsal deviation of the nasal tip septum.  The upper lateral cartilage was noted to be of the same width and length in size.  Yet, the left lower cartilage was scarred and adherent to the upper lateral cartilage.  The upper lateral cartilages were noted to be excessive of uneven length with the right being much taller than the left and that was shortened to the same length.  The scar bands were released in the lower lateral cartilages to the upper lateral cartilages to allow free mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages.  A middle crus stitch was used to unite the domes, and then the nose was projected by suturing the medial crural footplates of the caudal septum in deep projected fashion.  Crushed ear cartilage was then placed in the pockets above the spreader grafts in the area of the deficient dorsal nasal height and the lateral nasal sidewall height.  The spreader brought an excellent aesthetic appearance to the nose.  We left more than 1 cm of dorsal and caudal support for the nasal tip and dorsum height.  Mucoperichondrial flaps were closed with 4-0 plain gut suture.  The skin was closed with 5-0 chromic and 6-0 fast absorbing gut.  Doyle splints were placed on each side of nasal septum and secured with 3-0 nylon and a Denver splint was applied.  The patient was awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in good condition.","surgery, nasal deformity, nasal obstruction, nasal valve, cartilage, cartilaginous, crural, graft, nasal fracture, postauricular, rhinoplasty, septal cartilage, submucoperichondrial, turbinectomy, vestibular, ear cartilage graft, posttraumatic nasal deformity, vestibular stenosis, ear cartilage, cartilage graft, cartilages, caudal, nasal, nose, obstruction, repair, stenosis"

The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.

The left deltopectoral and cervical areas were prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated in the area.  There was some evidence that surgical procedure had happened in the area nearby and also there was collateral venous circulation under the skin, which made us suspicious that may be __________, but at any rate I tried to cannulate it subcutaneously and I was unsuccessful.  Therefore, I proceeded to make an incision and was able to isolate the vein, which would look very sclerotic.  I tried to cannulate it, but I could not advance the wire.,At that moment, I decided that there was no way we are going to put a port though that area.  I packed the incision and we prepped and redraped the patient including both groins.  Local anesthetic was infiltrated and then the left femoral vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  The introducer was placed and then a wire and then the catheter of the double lumen port, which had been trimmed to position it near the heart.  It was done with radiological guidance.  Again, I was able to position the catheter in the junction of inferior vena cava and right atrium.  The catheter was looked upwards and the double lumen port was inserted subcutaneously towards the iliac area.  The port had been aspirated satisfactorily and irrigated with heparin solution.  The drain incision was closed in layers including subcuticular suture with Monocryl.  Then, we went up to the left shoulder and closed that incision in layers.

He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy.  I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly.  The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.  The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side.  I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall.  Conservative management was not an option.  The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared.  I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family.  The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient.  An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such.  He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic.  Intubation was done under C-spine precautions.  The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron.  He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays.,With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped.  All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded.,Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine.  Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6.,Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes.,With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went.  I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord.  Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5.  Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved.  With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure.,The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant.  This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time.  I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis.  This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case.  Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow.,I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution.  These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position.  Excellent graft alignment was achieved.,I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6.  Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued.  The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately.  I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar.  Decision was made to start the closure.  So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin.  A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied.  The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition.,When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side.  He had done well from the surgery.  Blood loss was 350 cc.  All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct.  No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring.  No specimens were sent.,The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis.  The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity.  I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on.  I do not think there is need for halo rest.  We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning.  Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time.",

Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received.

The pain has started in the umbilical area and radiated to McBurney's point.  The patient appears to have a significant pain requiring surgical evaluation.  It did not appear that the pain was pelvic in nature, but more higher up in the abdomen, more towards the appendix.  The patient was seen by Dr. Y at my request in the ER with me in attendance.  We went over the case.  He decided that she should go to the operating room for evaluation and to have appendix evaluated and probably removed.  The patient on ultrasound had a 0.9 cm ovarian cyst on the right side.  The patient's cyst was not completely simple and they are concerns over the possibility of an abnormality.  The patient states that she has had chlamydia in the past, but it was not a pelvic infection more vaginal infection.  The patient has had hospitalization for this.  The patient therefore signed informed in layman's terms with her understanding that perceivable risks and complications, the alternative treatment, the procedure itself and recovery.  All questions were answered.  ,PROCEDURE: ,The patient was seen in the Emergency Room.  In the Emergency Room, there is really no apparent vaginal discharge.  No odor or cervical motion tenderness.  Negative bladder sweep.  Adnexa were without abnormalities.  In the OR, we were able to perform pelvic examination showing a slightly enlarged fibroid uterus about 9 to 10-week size.  The patient had no adnexal fullness.  The patient then underwent an insertion of a uterine manipulator and Dr. X was in the case at that time and he started the laparoscopic process i.e., inserting the laparoscope.  We then observed under direct laparoscopic visualization with the aid of a camera that there was pus in and around the uterus.  The both fallopian tubes were seen.  There did not appear to be hydrosalpinx.  The ovaries were seen.  The left showed some adhesions into the ovarian fossa.  The cul-de-sac had a banded adhesions.  The patient on the right adnexa had a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, where the cyst was only about a centimeter enlarged.  The ovary did not appear to have pus in it, but there was pus over the area of the bladder flap.  The patient's bowel was otherwise unremarkable.  The liver contained evidence of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome and prior PID.  The appendix was somewhat adherent into the retrocecal area and to the mid-quadrant abdominal sidewall on the right.  The case was then turned over to Dr. Y who was in the room at that time and Dr. X had left.  The patient's case was turned over to him.  Dr. Y was performed an appendectomy following which cultures and copious irrigation.  Dr. Y was then closed the case.  The patient was placed on antibiotics.

She was examined under anesthesia.  An 8-10 cm anteverted uterus was noted.  The patient was placed in the dorsal-lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, a sponge on a sponge stick was used in the place of a HUMI in order to not instrument the uterus in the event that this was a viable intrauterine pregnancy and this may be a desired intrauterine pregnancy.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a 5-mm incision was made in the inferior umbilicus.  The abdominal wall was tented and VersaStep needle was inserted into the peritoneal cavity.  Access into the intraperitoneal space was confirmed by a decrease in water level when the needle was filled with water.  No peritoneum was obtained without difficulty using 4 liters of CO2 gas.  The 5-mm trocar and sleeve were then advanced in to the intraabdominal cavity and access was confirmed with the laparoscope.,The above-noted findings were visualized.  A 5-mm skin incision was made approximately one-third of the way from the ASI to the umbilicus at McBurney's point.  Under direct visualization, the trocar and sleeve were advanced without difficulty.  A third incision was made in the left lower quadrant with advancement of the trocar into the abdomen in a similar fashion using the VersaStep.  The peritoneal fluid was aspirated and sent for culture and wash and cytology.  The abdomen and pelvis were surveyed with the above-noted findings.  No active bleeding was noted.  No evidence of ectopic pregnancy was noted.  The instruments were removed from the abdomen under good visualization with good hemostasis noted.  The sponge on a sponge stick was removed from the vagina.

He contacted myself and stated that Angelica was going to have her wisdom teeth extracted in the setting of a hospital operating room at Hospital and he inquired if we could pair on the procedure and I could do her full mouth dental rehabilitation before the wisdom teeth were removed by him.  I agreed.  I saw her in my office and she was cooperative for full mouth set of radiographs in my office and a clinical examination.  This clinical and radiographic examination revealed no dental caries; however, she was in need of a good dental cleaning.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,The patient was brought to Hospital Day Surgery accompanied by her mother.  I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restoration to be performed, and the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, they gave their informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia, she was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An Angiocath was previously placed in preop.  The head and neck were draped in sterile towels, and the body was covered with lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative digital intraoral photographs were taken.  No digital radiographs were taken in the operating room, as I stated before I had a full set of digital radiographs taken in my office.  A prophylaxis was then performed using a Prophy cup and fluoridated Prophy paste after scaling and replaning was done.  She presented with moderate calculus on the buccal surfaces of her maxillary, first molars and lower molars.  She did not require any restorative dentistry.,Upon the conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction and visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room, taken to the recovery room, breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS: , This patient presented in her permanent dentition.

There is moderate amount of synovitis noted throughout the glenohumeral joint.  There is a small subacromial spur noted on the very anterolateral border of the acromion.,HISTORY: , This is a 62-year-old female who previously underwent a repair of rotator cuff.  She continued to have pain within the shoulder.  She had a repeat MRI performed, which confirmed the clinical diagnosis of re-tear of the rotator cuff.  She wished to proceed with a repair.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her at length.  She was in agreement with the above treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 08/21/03, she was taken to the Operative Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was applied by the Anesthesiology Department.  She was placed in the modified beachchair position.  Her upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint.  A camera was placed in the joint and was insufflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained and the above findings were noted.  A second port site was initiated anteriorly.  Through this a probe was placed and the intraarticular structures were palpated and found to be intact.  A tear of the inner surface of the rotator cuff was identified.  The camera was then taken to the subacromial space.  A straight lateral portal was also used and a shaver was placed into the subacromial space.  Further debridement of the anterolateral border of the acromion was performed to remove evidence of the subacromial spur, which had reformed.  The edges of the rotator cuff were then debrided.  The camera was then removed and the shoulder was suction and dried.  A lateral incision was made over the anterolateral border of the acromion.  Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  The deltoid musculature was then incised and aligned with its fibers exposing the rotator cuff tear and the edges were further debrided using a rongeur.  A trough was then made in the greater tuberosity using the rongeur.  Two Panalok anchors were then placed within the trough and weaved through the suture and third Panalok anchor was placed medial to the trough and weaved through the rotator cuff.  The ends of the suture were tied down from the fixating the rotator cuff within the trough.  The rotator cuff was then further oversewed using the Panalok suture.  The wound was then copiously irrigated and it was then suction dried.  The deltoid muscle was reapproximated using #1 Vicryl.  A continuous infusion pump catheter was placed into the subacromial space to help with postoperative pain control.  The subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch.  Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity.  She was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer.  She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.  Prognosis for this patient was guarded.  She will begin pendulum exercises postoperative day #3.  She will follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for reevaluation.  Physical therapy initiated approximately six weeks postoperatively.","surgery, subacromial decompression, panalok suture, repair of rotator cuff, torn rotator cuff, diagnostic arthroscopy, subacromial space, subacromial spur, arthroscopy, panalok, shoulder, subacromial,"

The patient presented to Labor and Delivery with complaints of spontaneous rupture of membranes at 2000 hours on 12/26/2008.  She was found to be positive for Nitrazine pull and fern.  At that time, she was not actually contracting.  She was Group B Streptococcus positive, however, was 5 cm dilated.  The patient was started on Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis with ampicillin.  She received a total of three doses throughout her labor.  Her pregnancy was complicated by scanty prenatal care.  She would frequently miss visits.  At 37 weeks, she claims that she had a suspicious bump on her left labia.  There was apparently no fluid or blistering of the lesion.  Therefore, it was not cultured by the provider; however, the patient was sent for serum HSV antibody levels, which she tested positive for both HSV1 and HSV2.  I performed a bright light exam and found no lesions anywhere on the vulva or in the vault as per sterile speculum exam and consulted with Dr. X, who agreed that since the patient seems to have no active lesion that she likely has had a primary outbreak in the past and it is safe to proceed with the vaginal delivery.  The patient requested an epidural anesthetic, which she received with very good relief.  She had IV Pitocin augmentation of labor and became completely dilated per my just routine exam just after 6 o'clock and was set up for delivery and the patient pushed very effectively for about one and a half contractions.  She delivered a viable female infant on 12/27/2008 at 0626 hours delivering over an intact perineum.  The baby delivered in the occiput anterior position.  The baby was delivered to the mother's abdomen where she was warm, dry, and stimulated.  The umbilical cord was doubly clamped and then cut.  The baby's Apgars were 8 and 9.  The placenta was delivered spontaneously intact.  There was a three-vessel cord with normal insertion.  The fundus was massaged to firm and Pitocin was administered through the IV per unit protocol.  The perineum was inspected and was found to be fully intact.  Estimated blood loss was approximately 400 mL.  The patient's blood type is A+.

915, Spontaneous controlled sterile vaginal delivery performed without episiotomy., Surgery, Delivery Note - 1 ,"The patient presented in the early morning hours of February 12, 2007, with contractions.  The patient was found to be in false versus early labor and managed as an outpatient.  The patient returned to labor and delivery approximately 12 hours later with regular painful contractions.  There was minimal cervical dilation, but 80% effacement by nurse examination.  The patient was admitted.  Expected management was utilized initially.  Stadol was used for analgesia.  Examination did not reveal vulvar lesions.  Epidural was administered.  Membranes ruptured spontaneously.  Cervical dilation progressed.  Acceleration-deceleration complexes were seen.  Overall, fetal heart tones remained reassuring during the progress of labor.  The patient was allowed to ""labor down"" during second stage.  Early decelerations were seen as well as acceleration-deceleration complexes.  Overall, fetal heart tones were reassuring.  Good maternal pushing effort produced progressive descent.,Spontaneous controlled sterile vaginal delivery was performed without episiotomy and accomplished without difficulty.

Removal total shoulder arthroplasty (uncemented humeral Biomet component; cemented glenoid component).,3.  Implantation of antibiotic beads, left shoulder.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have findings consistent with a chronic and indolent infections.  Risks and benefits have been discussed with him and his family at length including but not exclusive of continued infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, fractures, loss of bone, medical complications, surgical complications, transfusion related complications, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Presumed infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Deep extensive infection, left total shoulder arthroplasty.,2.  Biceps tenosynovitis.,3.  Massive rotator cuff tear in left shoulder (full thickness subscapularis tendon rupture 3 cm x 4 cm; supraspinatus tendon rupture 3 cm x 3 cm; infraspinatus tear 2 cm x 2 cm).,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was anesthetized in the supine position, a Foley catheter was placed in his bladder.  He was then placed Beach chair position and all bony prominences were well padded.  Pillows were placed around his knees to protect his sciatic nerve.  He was brought to the side of the table and secured with towels and tape.  The head was placed in neutral position with no lateral bending or extension to protect the brachioplexus from any stretch.  Left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Unfortunately, preoperative antibiotics were given prior to the procedure.  This occurred due to lack of communication between the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff.  The patient's extremity, however, was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine prep after he had been draped.  Also, Ioban bandages were placed securely to the skin to prevent any further introduction of infection into his shoulder.,Deltopectoral incision was then made.  The patient's had a cephalic vein, it was identified and protected throughout the case.  It was retracted laterally and once this has been completed, the deltopectoral interval was developed as carefully as possible.  The patient did have significant scar from this point on and did bleed from many surfaces throughout the case.  As a result, he was transfused 1 unit postoperatively.  He did not have any problems during the case except for one small drop of blood pressure.  However this was due primarily because of the extensive scarring of his proximal humerus.  He had scar between the anterior capsular structures and the conjoint tendon.  Also there was significant scar between the deltoid and the proximal humerus.  The deltoid was very carefully and tediously removed from the proximal humerus in order not to damage the axillary nerve.  Once the plane between the deltoid and underlying tissue was found, the proximal humerus was discovered to have a large defect, approximately 4 x 3.  This was covered by rimmed fibrous tissue which was fairly compressible, which felt to be purulent, however, when the needle was stuck into this area, there was no return of fluid.  As a result, this was finally opened and found to have fibrinous exudates which appeared to be old congealed, purulent material.  There was some suggestion of a synovitis type reaction also inside this cystic area.  This was all debrided but was found to track all the way into the proximal humerus from the lateral femoral component and also tracked posteriorly through and around the posterior cortex of the proximal humerus indicating that the infraspinatus probably had some tearing and detachment.  This later proved to be the case and infraspinatus did indeed have a tear 2 cm x 2 cm.  All of the mucinous material and fibrinous material was removed from the proximal humerus.  This was fairly extensive debridement.  All of this was sent to pathology and also sent for culture and sensitivity.  It should be noted that Gram stain became as multiple white blood cells but no organism seen.  The pathology came back as fibrinous material with multiple white cells, also with signs of chronic inflammation consistent with an infection.,Attention was then directed towards the anterior structures to gain access to the joint so that we could dislocate the prosthesis and remove it.  There was also cystic area in the anterior aspect of the shoulder which was fairly fibrinous.  This was also removed.  Once this was removed, though the capsule was found to be very thin, there was essentially no subscapularis tendon whatsoever.  It should also noted the patient's proximal humerus was subluxed superiorly so that there was no supraspinatus tendon present whatsoever.  As a result, the biceps tendon was finally identified just below the pectoralis tendon insertion.  The upper 1 or 2 cm of the pectoralis insertion was released in order to find the biceps.  It was tracked proximally and transverse ligament released.  The biceps tendon was flat and somewhat erythematous.  As a result, it released and tagged with an 0 Vicryl suture.  It was later tenodesed to the conjoint tendon using 2-0 Prolene sutures.  The joint was then entered and noted significant synovitis throughout the entire glenoid.  This was all very carefully removed using a rongeur and sharp dissection.,Next, the humeral component was removed and this was done by attempting to remove it with the slap hammer and device which comes with the Biomet set.  Unfortunately, this device would not hold the proximal humerus and we could not get the component to release.  As a result, bone contact of the metal proximally was released using a straight osteotome.  Once this was completed, another attempt was made to remove the prosthesis but this only resulted in fracture of the proximal humerus through the areas of erosion of the infection and once this has been completed, we abandoned use of that particular device and using a __________ , we were able to hit the prosthesis lip from beneath and essentially remove it.  There was no cement.  There was exudate within the canal which was removed using a curette.,Using fluoroscopy, sequential reamers were placed to a size of 11 distally down the shaft to remove the exudate.  This was also thoroughly irrigated with irrigation antibiotic, and impregnated irrigation to decrease any risk of infection.  It should be noted that the reaming was done fluoroscopically to make sure that there was no penetration of the canal at any point.,The attention was then directed to the glenoid.  The glenoid component was very carefully dissected free and found to be very loose.  It was essentially removed with digital dissection.  There was no remaining cement in the cavity itself.  The patient's glenoid was very carefully debrided.  The glenoid itself was found to be very cup shaped with significant amount of bone loss in the central portion of the canal itself.  This was debrided using rongeurs and curette until there was no purulent exudate present anywhere in the glenoid itself.,Next, the entire wound was irrigated thoroughly with 9 liters of antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  Rather than place a spacer, it was elected to use antiobiotic beads.  This was with antibiotic impregnated cement with one package with 3 gram of vancomycin.  These beads were then connected using Prolene and placed into the glenoid cavity itself, also some were placed in the greater tuberosity region.  These three did not have a Prolene attached to them.  The ones placed down the canal did have a Prolene used as did the ones placed in the cavity of the glenoid itself.,The biceps tendon was then tenodesed under tension to the conjoint tendon.  There was essentially no capsule left purely to close over the proximal humerus.  It was electively the proximal humerus.  A portion of bone intact because it did have some bleeding surfaces.  Deltopectoral was then closed with 0-Vicryl sutures, the deep subcutaneous tissues with 0-Vicryl sutures, superficial subcutaneous tissues with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with staples.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.,It should be noted that __________ is being requested for this case.  This was a significantly scarred patient which required extra dissection and attention.  Even though this was a standard revision case due to infection, there was a significant more decision making and technical challenges in this case and this was present for typical revision case.  Similarly, this case took approximately 30 to 40% more length of time due to bleeding and the attention to hemostasis.  The blood loss and operative findings indicates that this case was at least 30 to 40% more challenging than a standard total shoulder or revision case.  This is being dictated for insurance purposes only and reflects no inherent difficulties with the case whatsoever.","surgery, incision and drainage, shoulder arthroplasty, extensive debridement, uncemented humeral, biomet, cemented, antibiotic beads, biceps tenosynovitis, rotator cuff tear, total shoulder arthroplasty, proximal humerus, vicryl sutures, glenoid, tendon, proximal, humerus, beads, shoulder, incision,"

Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment, as well as medial malleolar fragment.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right ankle trimalleolar fracture.,2.  Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 80 minutes.,HISTORY: , This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky.,The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour.  He was on a curve and lost control.  He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding.  There were no other injuries.  He was treated in Kentucky.  A close reduction was performed and splint applied.  Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan.  The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight.  The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed.  This was performed and reviewed.  The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days.  At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait.,Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches.  The patient was x-rayed in the office.  He had lost some of his reduction.  Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin.,An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally.  It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation.  This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted.,The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type.  The syndesmosis appeared to be intact.  This appeared as an AO type B fracture.  However, this was not a rotational injury.,There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted.  CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner.  A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate.  However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint.,There were many fragments and defects in this region.,The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment.,We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient.  He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness.  We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan.  We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery.  We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness.  Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot.,The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse.,The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly.  We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions.  We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally.  He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly.,We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula.  We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction.  He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space.  With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future.  We discussed hardware irritation.  We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly.  With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure.,OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic.  His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction.  It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular.,The reduction appeared to line up.  However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia.,A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue.  The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided.  The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula.,This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally.  The fracture was seen.  The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated.  The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect.  The posterior aspect was still intact.  However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury.  This was reduced manually.  At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon.  No sharp dissection was performed.  The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced.  The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well.,X-ray views confirmed this.,An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus.  This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue.  The saphenous vein was found, dissected out.  Its branches were cauterized.  Penrose drain was placed around this.,Dissection was undertaken.  The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint.,This was recovered and flipped back on both sides.  Next, the towel clip was used.  Ends were freshened up using irrigation.  The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially.,Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws.  Anatomic reduction was gained.  X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction.  Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula.  Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this.  Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture.  Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used.,The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction.  Screws were placed.  It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially.,Screw holes were filled.  They were double-checked.  Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up.  At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond.  This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia.,The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment.,A 2 mm K-wire was used.  Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger.  X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin.  This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed.  This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so.  On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint.  AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint.  One could palpate this as well.  The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane.  At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint.  There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment.  Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage.  Posterior splint was placed on the patient.  The patient's leg was placed in neutral position.  Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings.  The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding.  Tourniquet was deflated.  The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications.  Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied.  Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant.  As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue.  The patient is expected to do well overall.  He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan.  However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment.  Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area.",

She was 3 cm dilated on admission.  She desired induction of labor.  Therefore, Pitocin was started.  Epidural was placed for labor pain.  She did have a temperature of 100.7 and antibiotics were ordered including gentamicin and clindamycin secondary to penicillin allergy.  She remained febrile, approximately 100.3.  She then progressed.  On my initial exam at approximately 0730 hours, she was 3 to 4 cm dilated.  She had reported previously some mucous discharge with no ruptured membranes.  Upon my exam, no membranes were noted.  Attempted artificial rupture of membranes was performed.  No fluid noted and there was no fluid discharge noted all the way until the time of delivery.  Intrauterine pressure catheter was placed at that time to document there are adequate pressures on contraction secondary to induction of labor.  She progressed well and completely dilated, pushed approximately three times, and proceeded with delivery.,DELIVERY NOTE:,  Delivery is a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of an intrauterine fetal demise.  Fetal position is right occiput anterior.,COMPLICATIONS: , Again, intrauterine fetal demise.  Placenta delivery spontaneous.  Condition was intact with a three-vessel cord.  Lacerations; she had a small right periurethral laceration as well as a small second-degree midline laceration.  These were both repaired postdelivery with 4-0 Vicryl on an SH and a 3-0 Vicryl on a CT-1 respectively.  Estimated blood loss was 200 mL.,Infant is a male infant, appears grossly morphologically normal.  Apgars were 0 and 0.  Weight pending at this time.,NARRATIVE OF DELIVERY:,  I was called.  This patient was completely dilated.  I arrived.  She pushed for three contractions.  She was very comfortable.  She delivered the fetal vertex in the right occiput anterior position followed by the remainder of the infant.  There was a tight nuchal cord x1 that was reduced after delivery of the fetus.  Cord was doubly clamped.  The infant was transferred to a bassinet cleaned by the nursing staff en route.  The placenta delivered spontaneously, was carefully examined, found to be intact.  No signs of abruption.  No signs of abnormal placentation or abnormal cord insertion.  The cord was examined and a three-vessel cord was confirmed.  At this time, IV Pitocin and bimanual massage.  Fundus firm as above with minimal postpartum bleeding.  The vagina and perineum were carefully inspected.  A small right periurethral laceration was noted, was repaired with a 4-0 Vicryl on an SH needle followed by a small second-degree midline laceration, was repaired in a normal running fashion with a 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At this time, the repair is intact.  She is hemostatic.  All instruments and sponges were removed from the vagina and the procedure was ended.,Father of the baby has seen the baby at this time and the mother is waiting to hold the baby at this time.  We have called pastor in to baptize the baby as well as calling social work.  They are deciding on a burial versus cremation, have decided against autopsy at this time.  She will be transferred to postpartum for her recovery.  She will be continued on antibiotics secondary to fever to eliminate endometritis and hopefully will be discharged home tomorrow morning.,All of the care and findings were discussed in detail with Christine and Bryan and at this time obviously they are very upset and grieving, but grieving appropriately and understanding the findings and the fact that there is not always a known cause for a term fetal demise.  I have discussed with her that we will do some blood workup postdelivery for infectious disease profile and clotting disorders.","surgery, decreased fetal movement, labor pain, preterm labor, delivery note, vaginal delivery, fetal position, fetal demise, intrauterine, delivery, spontaneous, dilated, lacerations, cord, fetal "

An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2.  An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator.  The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent.  Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1.  The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle.  Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy.  The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11.  A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body.,Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation.  The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1.  Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body.,At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side.  Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis.  The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur.  It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12.,At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur.  There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space.  Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1.  These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur.  Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed.  The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free.  Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation.,At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile.  A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac.  Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement.  The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint.,With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed.  It was felt that distraction was not necessary.  A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod.  The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld.  Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws.  A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened.,It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints.  This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods.,Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters.  Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture.  The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples.  The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications.","surgery, facetectomies, decompression, posterolateral fusion, synthes click'x system, decompressive laminectomy, leksell rongeur, kerrison rongeur, transverse processes, thecal sac, nerve roots, pedicle screws, spinous process, pedicle, process, screws, rods, laminectomy, decompressive, spinous, "

The patient is a diabetic who requires insulin, but has been noncompliant and states that his blood sugars have been out of control.  He has had a groin abdominal wound drained for about four days.  The patient states that there has been pus that has saturated his sheath.  He has had a possible fever at home that he did not chart with a thermometer.  He has had the same groin infection twice in the past with tunneling lesions.  The patient states that his wife noted there was a round scar on his abdomen and that was black and had crept up in the last day.  Bowel habits and eating were essentially normal.,Urinary habits were normal.  The patient is morbidly obese and is approximately 450 lb.  He has not been following a diabetic diet or using insulin secondary to lack of funds to put his medications.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Diabetes, morbid obesity, and nephrolithiasis.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Appendectomy and stone extraction.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was examined in the Emergency Room by Dr. X and was found to have multiple areas of erythematous tissue, which could potentially be consistent with a necrotizing fascitis texture.  The patient had a white count of 11.4 and a hemoglobin of 13.4.  Please note that the patient is a Jehovah's Witness and has adamantly refused receiving any blood products.  The risks and benefits of such were discussed with the patient at length prior to surgery and he was permitted to make sure not to receive blood and his wishes will be granted.  In the operative suite, he was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was placed in a lithotomy position to visualize the peritoneum as well as the abdomen.  Copious amounts of Betadine solution were used to cleanse the area and the wound was visualized.  Approximately, 10 cm x 5 cm elliptical incision was made on the lower left quadrant of the abdomen surrounding the area of necrosis.  Necrotic tissue comprised approximately 2 cm x 2 cm area and was indurated.  The abdomen appeared to have a large erythematous border, however, the true indurated tissue was approximately the size of a deck of cards.  The area was incised using a #10 blade scalpel and then Bovie cauterization was used to achieve good hemostasis.  The tissue was removed using an Allis forceps as well as a Bovie to double the incision down to the fascia.  The necrotic tissue was lifted out of the abdomen.  All bleeding was cauterized using the Bovie.  A solution of gentamicin and sterile saline was placed into a high-powered water pump device and the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned.  A wet Kerlix dressing was passed into the wound and it will be left opened with wet-to-dry dressing.  The left groin area was also incised using an elliptical incision that was approximately 13 cm x 6 cm.  The tissue was incised to the muscle layer of the muscle.  There was a pus pocket that was visible with capsule as well and there was an area of the necrotic tissue as well.  There was a mild amount of pus that drained from the wound.  Cultures were taken from the groin wound and were sent to pathology.  The specimen was excised using traction with the Allis clamps as well as Bovie set on coag.  Once the tissue was excised from the ________, the area was fully irrigated using the gentamicin sterile saline solution in the high-powered water irrigation unit.  After the irrigation, the wound was packed using a wet Kerlix dressing and will be left open to heal.,It was determined at this time that both wounds will be left open to heal with the wet-to-dry dressings in place and we will come back and close the wounds at a later date.  The skin excised from the left lower abdominal quadrant as well as the left groin was sent to pathology.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in good condition.","surgery, debridement, abdomen, peritoneal, pannus, pathology, necrotizing infection, necrotic tissue, tissue, infection, necrotizing, groin, wound, "

They all consented for the procedure, and the consent was signed and placed on the chart.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to cardiac cath lab where she was monitored throughout all procedure.  The area of the left pectoral deltoid and subclavian area was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  We also scrubbed for approximately eight minutes.  Using lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left pectoral deltoid region and subclavian area was then fully anesthetized.  Using an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left subclavian vein was cannulated at two separate sites without difficulty, where two separate guidewires were inserted into the left subclavian vein.  The Cook needles were removed.  Then the guidewires were secured in place with hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectodeltoid groove, where the skin was dissected and blunted on to the pectoralis major muscle.  The skin was then undermined making a pocket for the generator.  The guidewires were then tunneled through the performed pocket.  Subsequently, the atrial and ventricular leads were inserted through each one of the Cordis separately and respectively.  Initially, the ventricular lead was inserted, where a Cordis sheath was placed and the guidewire was removed.  After the thresholds and appropriate position was obtained for the ventricular lead, the Cordis sheath was then inserted for the atrial lead.  After the atrial lead was inserted and appropriately placed and thresholds were obtained, the Cordis was removed and then both leads were sutured in place with pectoralis major muscle with #1-0 silk suture.  The leads were then connected to a pulse generator.  The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed, where then the leads and the generators were inserted into that pocket.

No adnexal masses, however, were appreciated on the bimanual exam.  Laparoscopically, the patient had numerous omental adhesions to the vesicouterine peritoneum in the fundus of the uterus.  There were also adhesions to the left fallopian tube and the right fallopian tube.  There was a copious amount of blood in the abdomen approximately 2 liters of clotted and unclotted blood.  There was some questionable gestational tissue ________ on the left sacrospinous ligament.  There was an apparent rupture and bleeding ectopic pregnancy in the isthmus portion of the right fallopian tube.,PROCEDURE:,  After an informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and the general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  A weighted speculum was then placed in the vagina.  The interior wall of vagina elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank and then a sharp curettage was performed obtaining a moderate amount of decidual appearing tissue and the tissue was then sent to pathology.  At this point, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior cervix and vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was then turned to the abdomen.  The surgeons all are removed the dirty gloves in the previous portion of the case.  Next, a 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and a Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Next, a syringe was used to inject normal saline into the Veress needle.  The normal saline was seen to drop freely, so a Veress needle was connected to the CO2 gas which was started at its lowest setting.  The gas was seen to flow freely with normal resistance, so the CO2 gas was advanced to a higher setting.  The abdomen was insufflated to an adequate distension.  Once an adequate distention was reached, the CO2 gas was disconnected.  The Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was placed.  The introducer was removed and the trocar was connected to the CO2 gas and a camera was inserted.  Next, a 1 cm incision was made in the midline approximately two fingerbreadths below the pubic symphysis after transilluminating with the camera.  A Veress needle and a step sheath were inserted through this incision.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #5 trocar was inserted under direct visualization.  Next a size #5 port was placed approximately five fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus in a similar fashion.  A size #12 port was placed in a similar fashion approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus and also under direct visualization.  The laparoscopic dissector was inserted through the suprapubic port and this was used to dissect the omental adhesions bluntly from the vesicouterine peritoneum and the bilateral fallopian tubes.  Next, the Dorsey suction irrigator was used to copiously irrigate the abdomen.  Approximate total of 3 liters of irrigation was used and the majority of all blood clots and free blood was removed from the abdomen.,Once the majority of blood was cleaned from the abdomen, the ectopic pregnancy was easily identified and the end of the fallopian tube was grasped with the grasper from the left upper quadrant and the LigaSure device was then inserted through the right upper quadrant with # 12 port.  Three bites with the LigaSure device were used to transect the mesosalpinx inferior to the fallopian tube and then transect the fallopian tube proximal to the ectopic pregnancy.  An EndoCatch bag was then placed to the size #12 port and this was used to remove the right fallopian tube and ectopic pregnancy.  This was then sent to the pathology.  Next, the right mesosalpinx and remains of the fallopian tube were examined again and they were seemed to be hemostatic.  The abdomen was further irrigated.  The liver was examined and appeared to be within normal limits.  At this point, the two size #5 ports and a size #12 port were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was then removed.  The CO2 gas was disconnected and the abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced in a size #11 port and the whole port and introducer was removed as a single unit.  All laparoscopic incisions were closed with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  They were then steri-stripped and bandaged appropriately.  At the end of the procedure, the uterine manipulator was removed from the cervix and the patient was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  She was discharged home with a postoperative hemoglobin of 8.9.  She was given iron 325 mg to be taken twice a day for five months and Darvocet-N 100 mg to be taken every four to six hours for pain.  She will follow up within a week in the OB resident clinic.","surgery, pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, hemoperitoneum, d&c, dilation, laparoscopy, curettage, salpingectomy, lysis of adhesions, bimanual exam, veress needle, fallopian tube, umbilicus, cervix, ectopic, pregnancy, abdomen, tube, "

The patient's traumatic wound was gently debrided and lavaged with a Pulsavac given the appearance of the patient's leg (there was some blistering of the skin).  The compartment pressures of the patient's four compartments were measured, for the anterior and lateral compartments the measurement was 32, for the posterior compartment superficial and deep, it was 34.  With this information, we proceeded with fasciotomy medially decompressing the superficial as well as the deep posterior compartments.  Muscle in these compartments was contractile.  Anterolateral incision was then made and carried down through the fascia anterolaterally with opening of the fascia on the anterior as well as the lateral compartment.  The lateral compartment appeared contractile.  The anterior compartment appeared necrotic for most of the muscle in the compartments.  What appeared viable was left intact.  A vacuum-assisted closure system was utilized on each fasciotomy wound.  Given the nature of the patient's foot, we proceeded with a fasciotomy of the patient's foot medially and good contractile muscle was found there.  This was included in the VAC seal, as well as the traumatic wound.

Laparoscopy with removal of tubal pregnancy and right partial salpingectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,Less than 100 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 25-year-old African-American female, gravida 7, para-1-0-5-1 with two prior spontaneous abortions with three terminations who presents with pelvic pain.  She does have a slowly increasing beta HCG starting at 500 to 849 and the max to 900.  Ultrasound showed a complex right lower quadrant mass with free fluid in the pelvis.  It was decided to perform a laparoscopy for the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy.,FINDINGS: , On bimanual exam, the uterus was approximately 10 weeks' in size, mobile, and anteverted.  There were no adnexal masses appreciated although there was some fullness in the right lower quadrant.  The cervical os appeared parous.,Laparoscopic findings revealed a right ectopic pregnancy, which was just distal to the right fallopian tube and attached to the fimbria as well as adherent to the right ovary.  There were some pelvic adhesions in the right abdominal wall as well.  The left fallopian tube and ovary and uterus appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  There was a small amount of blood in the posterior cul-de-sac.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite, prepped and draped, placed under general anesthesia, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The bimanual exam was performed, which revealed the above findings.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vaginal vault and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.  The cervix was then serially dilated using Hank dilators up to a #10.  A sharp curette was then introduced and curettage was performed obtaining a mild amount of tissue.  The tissue was sent to pathology for evaluation.  The uterine elevator was then placed in the patient's cervix.  Gloves were changed.  The attention was turned to the anterior abdominal wall where a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was placed without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty in abdominal wall.  The placement was confirmed with a laparoscope.  It was then decided to put a #5 step trocar approximately 2 cm above the pubis symphysis in order to manipulate the pelvic contents.  The above findings were then noted.  Because the tubal pregnancy was adherent to the ovary, an additional port was placed in the right lateral aspect of the patient's abdomen.  A #12 step trocar port was placed under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, Nezhat-Dorsey suction irrigator, the mass was hydro-dissected off of the right ovary and further shelled away with graspers.  This was removed with the gallbladder grasper through the right lateral port site.  There was a small amount of oozing at the distal portion of the fimbria where the mass has been attached.  Partial salpingectomy was therefore performed.  This was done using the LigaSure.  The LigaSure was clamped across the portion of the tube including distal tube and ligated and transected.

The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis.  The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially from 2-3 mm and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf.,The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat.  The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat.  The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors.,After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl.  Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture.  A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed.  The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches.,The first dorsal compartment was addressed through a transverse incision at the level of the radial styloid tip.  Dissection was carried down with care taken to avoid and protect the superficial radial nerve branches.  I released the compartment in a separate subsheath for the EPB on the dorsal side.

Laparoscopically, the patient has massive pelvic adhesions with completely obliterated posterior cul-de-sac and adnexa.,No adnexal structures were initially able to be visualized until after the lysis of adhesions.  Eventually we found a normal appearing right ovary, severely scarred right and left fallopian tubes, and a enlarged complex cystic left ovary.  There was a normal-appearing appendix and liver, and the vesicouterine junction appeared within normal limits.  There were significant adhesions from the small bowel to the bilateral adnexa in the posterior surface of the uterus.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where a general anesthetic was administered.  She was then positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Once the anesthetic was found to be adequate, a bimanual exam was performed under anesthetic.  Next, a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and anterior wall of the vagina was elevated with the uterine sound and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was then sounded to 12 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators to a size #20 Hank.  Next a Telfa pad was placed on the weighted speculum and a short curettage was performed obtaining a large amount of endometrial tissue.  Next, the uterine manipulator was placed in the cervix and attached to the anterior lip of the cervix.  At this point, the vulsellum tenaculum and weighted speculum were removed.  Next, attention was turned to the abdomen where an approximately 2 cm incision was made immediately inferior to the umbilicus.  The superior aspect of the umbilicus was grasped with a towel clamp and Veress needle was inserted through this incision.  Small amount of normal saline was injected into Veress needle and seemed to drop freely.  So, the Veress needle was connected to he CO2 gas, which was started at the lower setting.  It was seen to flow freely with a normal resistance so the gas was advanced to the higher setting.  The abdomen was then insufflated to an adequate distention.  Next, the Veress needle was removed and a size #11 step trocar was inserted.  Next, the introducer was removed from the trocar and the laparoscope was inserted through this port and the port was also connected to the CO2 gas.  At this point, the initial operative findings were seen.  Next, a size #5 step trocar was inserted approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis in the midline.  This was done by making a 1 cm incision with the skin knife, introducing a Veress needle with Ethicon sheet, and the Veress needle was then removed and the #5 port was introduced under direct visualization.  A size #5 port was also placed approximately six fingerbreadths to the right of the umbilicus in a similar manner also under direct visualization.  A blunt probe was inserted suprapubically along with a grasper in the right upper quadrant.  These were used to see the above operative findings.  Next, a size #12 mm port was introduced approximately seven fingerbreadths to the left of the umbilicus under direct visualization.  Through this, a Harmonic scalpel was inserted.,The Harmonic scalpel along with the grasper was used to meticulously address the adhesions along the right adnexa in the posterior cul-de-sac.  Care was taken at all times to avoid the bowel and the ureters.  The fallopian tubes appeared massively scarred and completely obliterated from disease.  After the right adnexa had been freed to the point where we could visualize the ovary and the posterior cul-de-sac was clearing off then we could visualize the uterosacral ligaments.  Attention was turned to the left adnexa, which appeared to contain a cystic structure, but it was unclear at the beginning of the procedure what the structure was.  Adhesions were carefully taken down from the bowel to the left fallopian tube and ovary, and sidewall.  The adhesions were then carefully removed from the inferior aspect of the ovary also with the Harmonic scalpel.  At intermittent points throughout the procedure, the suction irrigator was used to irrigate and suck blood and irrigation out of the pelvis to watch for any bleeding.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel was removed and another laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was inserted and this was used to aspirate approximately 30 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the cystic structure.  Next, the needle was removed and the ligature device was inserted.  This was used to clamp across the fallopian tube initially and then after the fallopian tube was ligated, the uterovarian ligament was clamped and ligated with the ligature device.  Next, the fallopian tube was removed from the ovary with the ligature device in approximately 3 clamping and ligations.  Then, the attention was turned to the inferior aspect of the ovary.  First the infundibulopelvic ligament was identified, clamped with a ligature device, and ligated.  Next, the ovary was bluntly dissected from the ovarian fossa with attention to the left ureter.  Next, the ligature device was used to clamp and ligate the broad ligament immediately inferior to the ovary across.  Then the ovary was completely bluntly dissected out of the ovarian fossa and completely separated from the pelvis.  This was grasped with a clamp.  The ligature device was removed from the #12 and a EndoCatch bag was inserted to the size #12 port.  The left ovary was placed in this EndoCatch bag, which was then removed along with the whole port from the left upper quadrant.  Next, the pelvis was copiously irrigated and suctioned of all blood and extra fluid.  At this point, the remaining two size #5 ports were removed under direct visualization.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was desufflated.  Next, an introducer was replaced on a #11 port.  The #11 port was removed.  Next, the fascia in the left upper quadrant port was identified and grasped with Ochsner clamps, tented up, and closed with a single interrupted suture of #0 Vicryl on a UR-6 needle.  Next, all skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular interrupted fashion.  The incisions were cleaned, injected with 0.25% Marcaine, and then adjusted with Steri-Strips and bandage appropriately.,The patient was taken from the operating room in stable condition and should be observed overnight in the hospital.",

She has heavy periods lasting 7 to 14 days with spotting in between her periods.  The patient's uterus is 12.2 x 6.2 x 5.3 cm.  Her endometrial thickness is 2 cm.  Her adnexa is within normal limits.  The patient and I had a long discussion.  Consent was reviewed in layman's terms.  The patient understood the foreseeable risks and complications, the alternative treatments and procedure itself and recovery.  Questions were answered.  The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  The patient underwent pelvic examination and then carefully placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had excellent femoral pulses and there was no excessive extension or hyperflexion of the lower extremities.  The patient's history is that she is at risk for development of condyloma.  The patient's husband was found to have a laryngeal papillomatosis.  She has had a laparotomy, which is an infraumbilical incision appendectomy, a laparoscopy, and bilateral tubal ligation.  Her uterus appears to be mobile by 12-week size.  There is a good descend.  There appears to be no adnexal abnormalities.  Uterus is 12-week sized and has fibroids, it is boggy and probably has a component of adenomyosis.  The patient's cervix was dilated without difficulty utilizing Circon ACMI hysteroscope with a 12-degree lens.  The patient underwent hysteroscopy.  The outflow valve was opened at all times.  The inflow valve was opened just to achieve appropriate distension.  The patient did have no evidence of trauma of the cervix.  No Trendelenburg as we were in room #9.  The patient also had the bag held two fingerbreadths above the level of the heart.  The patient was seen.  There is a 2 x 3 cm focal thickening of the posterior wall of the uterus' endometrial lining, a more of a polypoid nature.  The patient also has one in the fundal area.  The thickened tissue was removed via sharp curettage.  Therefore, we reinserted the hysteroscope.  It appeared that there was an appropriate curettage and that all areas of suspicion were indeed removed.  The patient's procedure was ended with specimen being obtained and sent to Department of Pathology.

The patient has had abnormal uterine bleeding since her delivery with an ultrasound showing a 6 cm x 6 cm fundal mass suspicious either for retained products or endometrial polyp.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was consented and seen in the preoperative suite.  She was taken to the operative suite, placed in a dorsal lithotomy position, and placed under IV sedation.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with the red Robinson catheter which produced approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was done, was performed by Dr. X and Dr. Z.  The uterus was found to be anteverted, mobile, fully involuted to a pre-pregnancy stage.  The cervix and vagina were grossly normal with no obvious masses or deformities.  A weighted speculum was placed in the posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with the vulsellum tenaculum.,The uterus was sounded to 8 cm.  The cervix was sterilely dilated with Hank dilator and then Hagar dilator.  At the time of blunt dilation, it was noticed that the dilator passed posteriorly with greater ease than it had previously.  The dilation was discontinued at that time because it was complete and the hysteroscope was placed into the uterus.  Under direct visualization, the ostia were within normal limits.  The endometrial lining was hyperplastic, however, there was no evidence of retained products or endometrial polyps.  The hyperplastic tissue did not appear to have calcification or other abnormalities.  There was a small area of the lower uterine segment posteriorly that was suspicious for endometrial perforation, however this area was hemostatic, no evidence of bowel involvement and was approximately 1 x 1 cm in nature.  The hysteroscope was removed and a sharp curette was placed intrauterine very carefully using a anterior wall for guidance.  Endometrial curettings were obtained and the posterior aspect suspicious for perforation was gently probed and seemed to have clamped down since the endometrial curetting.  The endometrial sampling was placed on Telfa pad and sent to Pathology for evaluation.  A rectal exam was performed at the end of the procedure which showed no hematoma formation in the posterior cul-de-sac.  There was a normal consistency of the cervix and the normal step-off.  The uterine curette was removed as well as the vulsellum tenaculum and the weighted speculum.  The cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The patient was taken off the dorsal lithotomy position and recovered from her IV sedation in the recovery room.  The patient will be sent home once stable from anesthesia.  She will be instructed to followup in the office in two weeks for discussion of the pathologic report of the endometrial curettings.  The patient is sent home on Tylenol #3 prescription as she is allergic to Motrin.  The patient is instructed to refrain from intercourse douching or using tampons for the next two weeks.  The patient is also instructed to contact us if she has any problems with further bleeding, fevers, or difficulty with urination.","surgery, dilation and curettage, hysteroscopy, abnormal uterine bleeding, spontaneous vaginal delivery, endometrial curettings, vaginal delivery, uterine bleeding, endometrial, d&c, cervix, vaginal, uterine, delivery,"

This patient had approximately greater than ten years of chronic pelvic pain with dysmenorrhea which has significantly affected her activities of daily living.  Symptoms have not improved with prescription of oral contraceptives.,The patient has had one prior surgery for a left ovarian cystectomy done by laparoscopy in 1996.  The cyst was not diagnosed as an endometrioma.  The patient does desire future fertility; however, would like a definitive diagnosis.  Conservative medical therapy was offered i.e.  Lupron or repeat oral contraceptives, but declined.,FINDINGS:,  Bimanual exam reveals a small retroverted uterus which is easily mobile.  There were no adnexal masses.  The cervix was normal on palpation.  A fibrotic band was noted at the internal os during dilation.  On laparoscopic exam, the uterus was found to be small with mild spongy texture.  On palpation, the right ovary and adnexa were grossly normal with no evidence of endometriosis.  The left ovary was grossly normal.  The left fallopian tube had a mild hydrosalpinx present.  The left uterosacral ligament had three to four 1 mm to 2 mm lesions that were vesicular in nature consistent with endometriosis.  The vesicouterine reflection in the anterior aspect of the uterus were within normal limits as were the posterior cul-de-sac.  The liver appeared grossly normal.  There were no obvious pelvic adhesions.  The left internal inguinal ring is somewhat patent, however, there is no bowel or viscera protruding through it.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was seen in the preop suite.  History was reviewed and all questions were answered.  The patient was then taken to the operative suite where she was placed under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube.  She was placed in a dorsal lithotomy position in Allen stirrups.  She was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter producing approximately 100 cc of clear yellow urine.  A bimanual exam was performed by Dr. X, Dr. Y, and Dr. Z with above findings noted.  A sterile weighted speculum was placed in posterior aspect of the vagina and the anterior aspect of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  There was an attempt to place the uterine sound through the external and internal cervical os, however, secondary to a fibrotic band at the internal os that was impossible.  A #9 dilator was allowed to remain in the cervix for minimal manipulation while attention was then turned to the abdomen.  An infraumbilical incision was made using skin scalpel.  The Veress needle was placed and CO2 was insufflated.  It was immediately noticed that the pressures were inconsistent with intraabdominal insufflation and the CO2 was discontinued and Veress needle was completely removed.  A second attempt placement of the Veress needle into the abdomen was successful and CO2 was insufflated approximately 3 liters with minimal intraabdominal pressure.  The #12 port was placed and the laparoscope was inserted.  Attention was then turned back to the uterus and with the assistance of current hemostat to bluntly dissect the fibrotic band of the internal os.,Successful sounding of the uterus showed an 8-cm uterus that was in a retroverted position.  The cervix was serially dilated using Hank dilators to allow for introduction of the sharp curette.  A curettage was then performed and specimen of the endometrium was sent for pathologic evaluation.  This procedure was performed under direct laparoscopic visualization.  Laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis was performed and the above findings noted.  A second abdominal incision was performed suprapubically using a skin scalpel and the Veress needle was placed through the incision successfully under direct visualization.  A #5 port was then placed through the sheath and the uterine manipulator was used to complete visualization.  The manipulator was then removed and the Harmonic scalpel was placed through the #5 port.  The Harmonic scalpel was used then to ablate the 1 mm vesicular lesions on the left uterosacral ligament.  The lesions were suspect for endometriosis, however, they were not diagnostic of endometriosis.  There was also present a 3 mm to 5 mm submucosal uterine fibroid on the right lower uterine segment.  The Harmonic scalpel was removed from the abdomen as was the #5 port.  The incision was internally found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope was then removed from the abdomen.  The abdomen was desufflated.  The introducer was then replaced into the #12 port and the #12 port was removed from the abdomen.  The uterine manipulator was removed from the uterus and the cervix was found to be hemostatic.  The weighted speculum was then removed.  The patient taken out of dorsal lithotomy position.  She was recovered from general anesthesia and taken to the postoperative suite for complete recovery.  The patient's discharge instructions will include a followup in one to two weeks in Dr. X's office for discussion of pathology.  Her family was notified of the findings.  She will be instructed not to have intercourse or use tampons or douche for the next two weeks.  The patient will be sent home with a prescription for Darvocet for pain.",

She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone.  She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter.  She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile.  She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia.  She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder.  The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities.  The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter.  This was gently advanced to the mid ureter.  Urine was collected for cytology.  Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen.  This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter.  An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter.  The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis.  Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected.  The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level.  There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones.  The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate.  The ureteroscope was then removed.  The cystoscope was reinserted.  Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system.  No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized.  The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system.  The cystoscope was removed.  Foley catheter was inserted.  The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, hydronephrosis, ureteropyelogram, ureterorenoscopy, flank pain, renal pelvis, urine cytology, ureteral, cystoscopy, barbotage, cystoscope, retrograde, urine, "

He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria.  He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation.,PROCEDURE: ,After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder.  The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing.,Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder.  There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice.  A retrograde pyelogram was performed.  Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side.  At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire.  The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities.  The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire.  The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance.  The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter.  The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction.  The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed.  A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation.  The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system.  Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system.  The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass.  Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed.  The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis.  The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder.  The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room.  It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy.  He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday.","surgery, renal mass, hematuria, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, cystourethroscopy, retrograde, pyelogram, ureteral pyeloscopy, renal biopsy, double-j, ureteral stent placement, ureteropelvic junction, flexible scope, papillary mass, ureteral stent, renal pelvis, ureteral orifice, amplatz wire, retrograde pyelogram, ureteral, cystoscope, ureteroscope, renal, bladder"

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).,ANESTHESIA: , General laryngeal mask.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 61-year-old white male who has been treated at the VA in Houston for a bladder cancer.  His history dates back to 2003 when he had a non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  He had multiple cystoscopies and followups since that time with no evidence of recurrence.  However, on recent cystoscopy, he had what appeared to be a recurrent tumor and was taken to the operating room and had this resected with findings of a Ta grade III transitional cell carcinoma associated with carcinoma in situ.  Retrograde pyelograms were suspicious on the right and cleared with ureteroscopy and the left renal pelvic washing was positive but this may represent contamination from the lower urinary tract as radiographically, there were no abnormalities.  I had cystoscoped the patient in the office showed during the period of time when he had significant irritative burning symptoms, and there were still healing biopsy sites.  We elected to allow his bladder to recover before starting the BCG.  We were ready to do that last week but two doctors and a nurse including myself were unable to pass Foley catheter.  I repeated a cystoscopy in the office with findings of a high bladder neck and BPH.  After a lengthy discussion with the patient and his wife, we elected to proceed with TURP after a full informed consent.,FINDINGS: , At cystoscopy, there was bilobular prostatic hyperplasia and a very high riding bladder neck, which may have been the predominant cause of his difficulty catheterizing and obstructive symptoms.  There were mucosal changes on the left posterior wall in the midline suspicious for carcinoma in situ.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position, his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23 French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings as described.  We removed the cystoscope and passed a #28 French continuous flow resectoscope sheath under visual obturator after dilating the meatus to #32 French with van Buren sounds.  Inspection of bladder again was made noting the location of the ureteral orifices relative to the bladder neck.  The groove was cut at 6 o'clock to open the bladder neck to verumontanum and then the left lobe was resected from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  Hemostasis was achieved, and then a similar procedure performed in the right side.  We resected the anterior stromal tissue and the apical tissue and then obtained complete hemostasis.  Chips were removed with Ellik evacuator.  There was no bleeding at the conclusion of the procedure, and the resectoscope was removed.  A #24 French three-way Foley catheter was placed with efflux of clear irrigant.  The patient was returned to the supine position, awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.","surgery, urinary bladder, benign prostatic hypertrophy, transurethral resection of the prostate, turp, acmi panendoscope, van buren sounds, transitional cell carcinoma, foley catheter, bladder neck, bladder, carcinoma, cystoscopy"

During the course of his workup of transurethral resection, he had a heart attack when he was taken off Plavix after having had a drug-eluting stent placed in.  He recovered from this and then underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy with a brief response documented by cystoscopy and biopsy after which he had another ischemic event.  The patient has been followed regularly by myself and Dr. X and has been continuously free of diseases since that time.  In that interval, he had a coronary artery bypass graft and was taken off of Plavix.  Most recently, he had a PET CT, which showed new right hydronephrosis and a followup cystoscopy, which showed a new abnormality in the right side of his bladder where he previously had the tumor resected and treated.  I took him to the operating room and extensively resected this area with findings of a high-grade muscle invasive bladder cancer.  We could not identify the right ureteral orifice, and he had a right ureteral stent placed.  Metastatic workup was negative and Cardiology felt he was at satisfactory medical risk for surgery and he was taken to the operating room this time for planned salvage cystoprostatectomy.  He was interested in orthotopic neobladder, and I felt like that would be reasonable if resecting around the urethra indicated the tissue was healthier.  Therefore, we planned on an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,On exploration, there were multiple abnormalities outside the bladder as follows:  There were at least three small lesions within the distal small bowel, the predominant one measured about 1.5 cm in diameter with a white scar on the surface.  There were two much smaller lesions also with a small white scar, with very little palpable mass.  The larger of the two was resected and found to be a carcinoid tumor.  There also were changes in the small bowel mesentry that looked inflammatory and biopsies of this showed only fibrous tissue and histiocytes.  The small bowel mesentry was fairly thickened at the base, but no discrete abnormality noted.,Both common iliac and lymph node samples were very thickened and indurated, and frozen section of the left showed cancer cells that were somewhat degenerative suggesting a chemotherapy and radiation therapy effect; viability was unable to be determined.  There was a frozen section of the distal right external iliac lymph node that was negative.  The bladder was very thickened and abnormal suggesting extensive cancer penetrating just under the peritoneal surface.  The bladder was fairly stuck to the pelvic sidewall and anterior symphysis pubis requiring very meticulous resection in order to get it off of these structures.  The external iliac lymph nodes were resected on both sides of the obturator; the lymph packet, however, was very stuck and adherent to the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove that.  The rest of the large bowel appeared normal.  There were no masses in the liver, and the gallbladder was surgically absent.  There was nasogastric tube in the stomach.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operative suite, and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, having placed in the supine position and flexed over the anterior superior iliac spine, his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The radiologist placed a radial arterial line and an intravenous catheter.  Intravenous antibiotics were given for prophylaxis.  We made a generous midline skin incision from high end of the epigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deepened through the rectus fascia, and the rectus muscles separated in the midline.  Exploration was carried out with the findings described.  The bladder was adherent and did appear immobile.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor was placed for exposure.  We began by assessing the small and large bowel with the findings in the small bowel as described.  We subsequently resected the largest of the lesions by exogenous wedge resection and reanastomosed the small bowel with a two-layer running 4-0 Prolene suture.  We then mobilized the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure after incising the white line of Toldt and mobilized the terminal ileal mesentery up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureters were carefully dissected out and down deep in the true pelvis.  The right ureter was thickened and hydronephrotic with a stent in place and the left was of normal caliber.  I kept the ureters intact until we were moving the bladder off as described above.  At that point, we then ligated the ureters with the RP-45 vascular load and divided it.,We then established the proximal ____________ laterally to both genitofemoral nerves and resected the precaval and periaortic lymph nodes.  The common iliac lymph nodes remained stuck to the ureter.  Frozen section with the findings described on the left.,I then began the dissection over the right external iliac artery and vein and had a great deal of difficulty dissecting distally.  I was, however, able to establish the distal plane of dissection and a large lymph node was present in the distal external iliac vessels.  Clips were used to control the lymphatics distally.  These lymph nodes were sent for frozen section, which was negative.  We made no attempt to circumferentially mobilize the vessels, but essentially, swept the tissue off of the anterior surface and towards the bladder and then removed it.  The obturator nerve on the right side was sucked into the pelvic sidewall, and I elected not to remove those.  On the left side, things were a little bit more mobile in terms of the lymph nodes, but still the obturator lymph nodes were left intact.,We then worked on the lateral pedicles on both sides and essentially determined that I can take these down.  I then mobilized the later half of the symphysis pubis and pubic ramus to get distal to the apical prostate.  At this point, I scrubbed out of the operation, talked to the family, and indicated that I felt the cystectomy was more palliative than therapeutic, and I reiterated his desire to be free of any external appliance.,I then proceeded to take down the lateral pedicles with an RP-45 stapler on the right and clips distally.  The endopelvic fascia was incised.  I then turned my attention posteriorly and incised the peritoneum overlying the anterior rectal wall and ramus very meticulously dissected the rectum away from the posterior Denonvilliers fascia.  I intentionally picked down those two pedicles lateral to the rectum between the clips and then turned my attention retropubically.  I was able to pass a 0 Vicryl suture along the dorsal venous complex, tied this, and then, sealed and divided the complex with a LigaSure and oversewed it distally with 2-0 Vicryl figure-of-eight stitch.  I then divided the urethra distal to the apex of the prostate, divided the Foley catheter between the clamps and then the posterior urethra.  I then was able to take down the remaining distal attachments of the apex and took the dissection off the rectum, and the specimen was then free of all attachments and handed off the operative field.  The bivalved prostate appeared normal.  We then carefully inspected the rectal wall and noted to be intact.  The wound was irrigated with 1 L of warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection made for hemostasis and a dry pack placed in the pelvis.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stoma and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,The stoma was returned to the umbilicus after resecting the terminal ileum.,We then placed a large JP drain into both obturator fossae and brought it up the right lower quadrant.  Rectus fascia was closed with buried #2 Prolene stitch anchoring a new figure of 8 at each end tying the two stitches above and in the middle and underneath the fascia.  Interrupted stitches were placed as well.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated and skin closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 2500 mL.  The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and taken on a stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.",

The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics.","surgery, infected stent, cysto stent removal, cysto stent, renal stone, lower pole, infected, stone, stent, cysto,"

General anesthesia was accomplished.  A 16-French Foley was placed using aseptic technique.  The patient was then placed on the operating table prone.  His right flank was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  At this point, contrast was injected through his existing nephrostomy tube and there was no continuity with the collecting system and it was removed.  The 5-French Pollack catheter was used to pass a 0.38 super-stiff Amplatz wire.  The wire would not go down the ureter.  Multiple attempts were made using Pollack catheters and Cobra catheters and attempts were made to dilate the track, both with rigid dilator and the balloon dilator and access could not be obtained.  After multiple attempts, access was lost.  At this point, the tubes were left out of the kidney and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient was then placed on another operating table supine.  His genitalia were prepped and draped after removing his Foley catheter.  Flexible cystoscopy was performed and the right orifice identified, which was edematous and erythematous.  The wire was passed up to kidney and a 5-French Pollack catheter was then passed over to after the removing the scope.  The wire was removed.  Contrast injection with good placement in the collecting system.  The wire was replaced.  The Pollack catheter removed and 6-French variable length double-J stent was inserted using fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire was removed leaving the double-J stent in good position.  _______ 16-French Foley was reinserted and connected to close drains.,Procedure was terminated at this point and had been well tolerated.

A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder.  The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected.  He had an obstructing prostate.  He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder.  He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor.  He had a huge bladder calculus.  It was white and round.,I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone.  There was still stone left at the end of the procedure.  Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik.,Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder.,The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB.  We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP.  We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient.","surgery, prostatism, holmium laser cystolithalopaxy, urinary tract infections, holmium laser, bladder calculus, bladder, cystolithalopaxy, diabetic, urethra, urinary, catheterization, stone, calculus, prostate,"

He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally.  Plan is for another injection.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given.  He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs.  His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule.  A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used.  His urethra was normal without valves or strictures.  His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted.  Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone.  This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well.  It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection.  We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect.  Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding.  Similar procedure was done on the left.  This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed.  There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection.  At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to Recovery.  A low-dose of IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure as well.","surgery, bilateral vesicoureteral reflux, deflux, sting procedure, hit technique, cystoscopy under anesthesia, hit/sting with deflux, vesicoureteral reflux, ureteral orifices, vesicoureteral, cystoscopy, urethra, hit/sting, ureteral,"

The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system.  Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed.  A semirigid ureteroscopy was done.  A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter.  Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces.  Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed.  Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative.  There were no further stones.  Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal.  The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent.  There were no further stones.  Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours.  Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed.  There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side.  The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs.  The patient had hematuria.  Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy.  The patient came in again with gross hematuria.  The first biopsy was done about a month ago.  The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria.  The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed.

Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed.  The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder.  There was a tight bladder neck contracture.  The prostate was not enlarged.  Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed.  It took about half an hour to just remove the clots.  After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected.  This was lateral to the left ureteral opening.  The base was coagulated for hemostasis.  Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized.  The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal.  Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal.  The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots.  The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening.  A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation.  The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal.  At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started.

On laparoscopy in May of 2003, PID, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids were demonstrated.  The patient desires definitive treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY:  ,Uterus was retroverted and somewhat boggy on bimanual examination without any palpable adnexal abnormalities.  On laparoscopic examination, the uterus was quite soft and boggy consistent with the uterine adenomyosis.  There was also evidence of fibroid change in the right fundal aspect of the uterus.  There was a white exudative material covering the uterus as well as bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes.  There were filmy adhesions to the right pelvic side wall, as well as left pelvic side wall.,PROCEDURE: , The patient taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was initially placed and was noted to be draining clear to yellow urine.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The bladder was elevated and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus sounded to 7 cm and the cervix was then progressively dilated.  A #20 Hank dilator, which was left within the cervix used in conjunction with the vulsellum tenaculum as a uterine manipulator.  At this time, after the gloves were changed, attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen.  A small approximately 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made with the scalpel.  A Veress needle was then inserted through this incision and a pneumoperitoneum was created with CO2 gas with appropriate volumes and pressures.  A #10 mm step trocar was then inserted through this site and intraabdominal placing was confirmed with the laparoscope.  On entrance into the patient's abdomen and pelvis, survey of the abdomen and pelvis revealed the operative area to be relatively free of adhesions except for the right pelvic saddle in which there were filmy adhesions.  There was also white exudate noted covering the surface of the uterus and adnexa and the uterus had a quite boggy appearance.  At this time, under transillumination in the left anterior axillary line, a second incision was made with a scalpel and through this site a #12 mm step trocar was inserted under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  A third incision was made in the right anterior axillary line under transillumination and through this site a second #12 mm step trocar was placed under direct visualization by the laparoscope.  Then 2 cm above the pubic symphysis in the midline and fourth incision was made and a #5 mm step trocar was inserted through this site.  The uterus was elevated and deviated to the patient's right and infundibulopelvic ligament on the left was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  The Endo-GIA was placed through the left sided port and was fired was to cross the infundibulopelvic ligament and down passed to the level of the round ligament, transecting and stapling at the same time.  Attention was then turned to the right adnexa.,The uterus was brought over to the patient's left and the right infundibulopelvic ligament was placed on tension with the aid of a grasper.  An Endo-GIA was used to transect and staple this vasculature and down passed to the level of round ligament.  At this time, there was noted to be a small remnant of the round ligament on the right and a Harmonic scalpel was used to complete the transection and was found to be hemostatic.  In addition, on the left the same procedure was performed to completely transect the round ligament on the left and a good hemostasis was noted.  At this time, the uterus was dropped and the vesicouterine peritoneum was grasped with graspers.  The bladder was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and hemostasis was appreciated.  The anterior cervix of the uterus was scored in the midline up to the level of the fundus with the aid of a Harmonic scalpel and then out to the adnexa bilaterally to aid in orientation during the vaginal portion of the procedure.  At this time, copious suction irrigation was performed and the operative sites were found to be hemostatic.  The pneumoperitoneum was the evacuated and the attention was then turned to the vaginal portion of the procedure.  The weighted speculum was placed into the patient's vagina.  At this time, the Foley catheter was noted to have ________ and there was noted to be a small puncture site noted into the Foley bulb.  The Foley catheter was replaced and the bladder was to be filled at a later time with methylene blue to rule out any bladder injury during the laparoscopic part of the procedure.  The cervix was then grasped from right to left with a Lahey clamps and the anterior vaginal mucosa was placed on stretch with aid of Allis clamps.  The vaginal mucosa anteriorly was then incised with aid of a scalpel from the 9 o'clock position to 3 o'clock position.  The anterior vaginal mucosa and bladder were suctioned and were then dissected away from the lower uterine segment with the aid of Mayo scissors and blunt dissection until anteriorly the peritoneal cavity was entered at which time the peritoneal incision was extended bluntly.  Next, using Lahey clamps serially following the ________ placed by the Harmonic scalpel from above were followed up to the pubic uterine fundus until the uterus was delivered into the vagina anteriorly.  At this time, two curved Heaney clamps were placed across the uterine artery on the right.  This was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The second clamp was advanced to incorporate the cardinal ligament complex and this was then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  Attention was then turned to the left uterine artery which was again doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  This second clamp was then advanced to capture the vasculature and the cardinal ligament complex.  This was again transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.,Next, the uterosacral were clamped off with the curved Heaney clamps and this clamp was met in the midline by another clamp just underneath the cervix and clamping off of the vaginal cuff.  Next the uterus, ovaries and cervix were transected away from the vaginal cuff with the aid of double pointed scissors and this specimen was handed off to pathology.  At this time, the bladder was instilled with approximately 800 cc of methylene blue and there was no evidence of any leak of blue dye as could be seen from the prospective of the vaginal portion of the procedure.  Next, the posterior vaginal cuff and posterior peritoneum were incorporated in a running lock stitch of #0 Chromic beginning at the 9'o clock position over to the 3'o clock position.  Next, the anterior vaginal mucosa was grasped with the Allis clamp and the peritoneum was identified anteriorly.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then closed with #0 Chromic suture figure-of-eight stitch with care taken to incorporate the anterior vaginal mucosa, the anterior peritoneum, and the previously closed posterior vaginal mucosa and the posterior peritoneum.  Two additional sutures medially were placed and these were tagged and not tied in place.  A #0 Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle was used to perform the McCall's culdoplasty type approximation with the vaginal cuff to open and the uterosacral ligament visualized.  This was then tied in place and the remainder of the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Chromic suture with figure-of-eight stitches.  At this time, the gloves were changed and attention was returned to the laparoscopic portion of the procedure at which time the abdomen was re-insufflated and the patient was placed in Trendelenburg.  The bowel was moved out of the way and copious suction irrigation was performed and all operative areas were noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder was again filled with approximately 400 cc methylene blue and from the laparoscopic ________ point there was no evidence of leakage of blue dye at this time.  The pneumoperitoneum was then evacuated and a cystoscopy was performed filling the bladder with approximately 400 cc of normal saline and there was noted to be a pinpoint perforation right on bladder dome which was found to be hemostatic and was not found to have any leakage at this time.  The bladder was then drained and the Foley catheter was replaced and after gloves changed, attention was turned to the abdomen with the laparoscopic instruments removed from the patient's abdomen.  The skin incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine in total were injected at incision site for additional analgesia.  The Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and taken to recovery in stable condition.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The specimens include the uterus, cervix, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes.  The patient will have her Foley catheter maintained for approximately 7 to 10 days.","surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, pelvic adhesions, pelvic pain, fibroid uterus, enterocele, salpingo-oophorectomy, mccall's culdoplasty, cystoscopy, laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy, foley catheter, vaginal mucosa, vaginal cuff, bladder, ligament, clamps, suture, pelvic, uterus, vaginal, inflammatory, laparoscopic, "

954," CT-guided needle placement, CT-guided biopsy of right renal mass, and embolization of biopsy tract with gelfoam.", Surgery, CT-Guided Biopsy - Kidney ,"REASON FOR EXAM:  This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X.,PROCEDURE:  The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient.  The patient understood.  All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained.  With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney.  Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored.  The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously.,Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach.  Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution.  CT documented needle placement.  Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly.  I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding.  The bleeding stopped.  The co-axial sheath was then removed.  Bandage was applied.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained.  The patient's hematoma appeared stable.  The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort.  The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable.  The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care.,FINDINGS:  Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.  Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass.  Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass.  There are small droplets of air within the hematoma.  No hydronephrosis is identified.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution.,2.  Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.","surgery, embolization, ct localization, gelfoam pledgets, ct guided needle placement, ct guided biopsy, needle placement, renal mass, ct guided, inferior pole, ct, biopsy, hematoma, kidney, mass,"

He was rendered unconscious by the head injury.  He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi.  This workup was negative.  The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker.  The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma.  There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes.  I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity.  The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion.  There was a roll beneath the right shoulder.  The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint.  Markings were applied.  Sterile drapes were applied.  A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline.  Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia.  Weitlaner retractors were inserted.  A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle.  I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis.  A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm.  The bone was set aside.  The dura was clearly discolored and very tense.  The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade.  There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure.  Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity.  The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section.  The margins of the membrane were coagulated.  The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none.  The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon.  Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system.  The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers.  Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon.,Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.,FINDINGS: , Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane.,I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure.  Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.","surgery, frontotemporal, weitlaner, calvarium, cookie cutter type, craniotomy, dura, frontotemporal craniotomy, galea, hematoma, subdural, subdural hematoma, syncopal, temporalis, subacute subdural hematoma, temporalis muscle,"

Left temporal craniotomy.,2.  Removal of brain tumor.,OPERATING MICROSCOPE: , Stealth.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side.  The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation.  Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull.  A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome.  The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution.,The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion.  Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle.  We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this.  We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface.  Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance.  We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid.  This was submitted to pathology.  We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology.  They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme.  With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor.  It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed.  We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially.  We could see it through the ventricle.  After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal.  The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system.  The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used for skin closure.  The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc.  There were no complications of the surgery per se.  The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct.,COMMENT:  ,Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain.","surgery, temporal lobe, brain tumor, lorenz titanium plate, burr hole, cortex, corticectomy, craniotome, craniotomy, frozen section, glioblastoma multiforme, temporal craniotomy, temporoparietal, ventricle, white matter, tumor, temporal, brain,"

He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency.  He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury.  His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric.,The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia.  He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy.  The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition.  He was fixed in a three-point headrest.  His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol.  We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region.  The scalp was reflected.  A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created.  After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain.  The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up.  We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline.  After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline.  We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates.  The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment.  Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.,I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this.  I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain.","surgery, subdural, hematoma, temporal craniotomy, craniotomy, subdural space, bur hole, subdural hematoma, "

Bilateral orbital frontal zygomatic craniotomy (skull base approach).,2.  Bilateral orbital advancement with (C-shaped osteotomies down to the inferior orbital rim) with bilateral orbital advancement with bone grafts.,3.  Bilateral forehead reconstruction with autologous graft.,4.  Advancement of the temporalis muscle bilaterally.,5.  Barrel-stave osteotomies of the parietal bones.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE: , After induction of general anesthesia, the patient was placed supine on the operating room table with a roll under his shoulders and his head resting on a foam doughnut.  Scalp was clipped.  He was prepped with ChloraPrep.  Incision was infiltrated with 0.5% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 and he received antibiotics and he was then reprepped and draped in a sterile manner.,A bicoronal zigzag incision was made and Raney clips used for hemostasis.  Subcutaneous flaps were developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  These were subgaleal flaps.  Bipolar and Bovie cautery were used for hemostasis.  The craniectomy was outlined with methylene blue.  The pericranium was incised exposing the bone along the outline of the craniotomy.,Paired bur holes were drilled anteriorly and posteriorly straddling the metopic suture.  One was just above the nasion and the other was near the bregma.  Also bilateral pterional bur holes were drilled.  There was a little bit of bleeding from a tributary of the sagittal sinus anteriorly and so bone wax was used for hemostasis in all the bur holes.,The dura was separated with a #4 Penfield dissector and then the craniotomies were fashioned or cut.  I should say with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit and the footplate attachment, the bilateral craniotomies were cut and then the midline piece was elevated separately.  Great care was taken when removing the bone from the midline.  Bipolar cautery was used for bleeding points on the dura and especially over the sagittal sinus and the bleeding was controlled.,The wound was irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.,The next step was to perform the orbital osteotomies with careful protection of the orbital contents.  Osteotomies were made with the Midas Rex drill using the V5 bit in the orbital roof bilaterally.  This was a very thick and vertically oriented orbital roof on each side.  Midas Rex drill and osteotomes and mallet were used to cut these osteotomies using retractors to protect the orbital contents and the dura.  The osteotomies were carried down through the tripod of the orbit and down through the lateral orbital rim and all the way down to the inferior orbital rim using the osteotome and mallet.  Bone wax was used for hemostasis.  It was necessary to score the undersurface of the bone at the midline because it was so thick and pointed.  So we were not going to be able to effect the orbital advancement without scoring the bone and thinning it out a bit.  This was done with the Midas Rex drill using B5 bit.  Also, the marked ridge just above the nasion was burred down with the Midas Rex drill.  The osteotomies were also carried down through the zygoma.  At this point, with a gentle rocking motion and sustained pressure using the osteotomes, it was then possible to carefully advance the orbital rims bilaterally, first on the right and then on the left again using just a careful rocking motion against the remaining bone to gently bend the orbital rims outward bilaterally.,Dr. X cut the bone grafts from the bone flaps and I fashioned a shelf to secure the bone graft by burring a ledge on the internal surface of the superior orbital rim.  This created a shelf for the notched bone graft to lean against basically anteriorly.  The posterior notch of the bone graft was able to be braced by the ledge of orbital roof posteriorly.,The left medial orbital rim greenstick fractured a bit, but the bone graft appeared to stay in place.,Holes were then cut in the supraorbital rim for advancement of the temporalis muscle and then a Synthes mesh was placed anteriorly using absorbable screw hardware and attached the mesh where the forehead bone flaps turned around and recontoured to make a nice bilateral forehead for Isaac.,At this point the undersurface of the temporalis muscle was scored using the Bovie cautery to allow advancement of the muscle anteriorly and we sutured it to the supraorbital rims bilaterally with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  This helped fill-in the indentation left by the orbital advancement at the temporal region.,Also, I separated the undersurface of the dura from the bone bilaterally and cut multiple barrel-stave osteotomies in the parietal bones and then greenstick fractured these barrel-staves outward to create a more normal contour of the bone slightly posteriorly.,At this point, Gelfoam had been used to protect the dura over the sagittal sinus during this part of the procedure.,The wound was then irrigated with bacitracin irrigation.  Bleeding had been controlled during the procedure with Bovie and bipolar electrocautery, even so the blood loss was fairly significant adding up to about 300 or 400 mL and he received that much in packed cells and he also received a unit of fresh frozen plasma.,At this point, the reconstruction looked good.  The advancement was about 1 cm and we were pleased with the results.  The wound was irrigated and then the Gelfoam over the midline dura was left in place and the galea was then closed with #4-0 and some #3-0 Vicryl interrupted suture and #5-0 mild chromic on the skin.  The patient tolerated procedure well.  No complications.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Again, blood loss was bout 300 to 400 mL and he received 2 units of blood and some fresh frozen plasma.","surgery, metopic synostosis, trigonocephaly, bilateral orbital frontal zygomatic craniotomy, skull base approach, orbital advancement, c-shaped osteotomies, forehead reconstruction, temporalis muscle, midas rex drill, frontal zygomatic, sagittal sinus, orbital roof, orbital rim, bone grafts, forehead, bone, orbital, craniotomy, osteotomies, "

The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery.  She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins.  The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion.  Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified.  The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine.  Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease.  The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use.,Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip.  Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone.  Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax.  Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure.  Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed.  The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly.  From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed.  Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use.  The bone flap was also left at the site for further use.  Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base.  Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus.  There was extensively aerated temporal bone.  At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor.  The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure.  Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone.  The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone.  Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out.  The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm.  There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well.  The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor.  The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult.  Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor.  With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem.  The eighth nerve was identified and transected.  Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem.  The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well.  It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve.  Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed.  The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus.  At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct.  The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated.  The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor.  The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face.  Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally.  However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.  However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness.  It was released from the brainstem ventrally.  The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery.  The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes.  Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume.  At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis.  The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax.  A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect.  Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal.  The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect.  Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels.  Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition.

The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The CUSA was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth, which was used to localize the tumor.  Following this, we then made a transverse linear incision, the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor.  The bone flap was elevated.  The ultrasound was then used.  The ultrasound showed the tumors directly I believe are in the interhemispheric fissure.  We noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation.  We gave 4 ounce of mannitol, the brain became more pulsatile.  We then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy.  Once this was done, the brain began to pulsate nicely.  We then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted U fashion based on the superior side of the sinus.  After having done this we then used operating microscope and slight self-retaining retraction was used.  We obtained access to the tumor.  We biopsied this and submitted it.  This was returned as a malignant brain tumor - metastatic tumor, adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer.,Following this we then debulked this tumor using CUSA and then removed it in total.  After gross total removal of this tumor, the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery.  The next step was after removal of this tumor, closure of the wound, a large piece of Duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with Lorenz plates.  The tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor, we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle.  This being the case, we left this ventricular catheter in, brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage.  The next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap.  The galea was closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 3-0 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures.  The sterile dressings were applied to the scalp.  The patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation.,Once again, we performed occipital craniotomy, total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.  The tumor was removed using the combination of CUSA, ultrasound, stealth guided-ventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today, we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.","surgery, brain tumor, cusa, occipital, adenocarcinoma, bone flap, craniotomy, malignant, metastatic, scalp galea, transverse linear incision, ventriculostomy, occipital craniotomy, tumor, stealth, brain, "

Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago.  A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation.  She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair.  Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression.  She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed.  Consequently, this operation is performed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol.  She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.  She was well padded, secured, and so forth.  The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions.  The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint.  This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system.  Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed.  A biparietal incision was performed.  A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation.  A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system.  The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline.  An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor.  This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor.  The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels.  At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region.  Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled.  Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound.,Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area.  A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve.  Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull.  A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome.  A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter.  It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus.  Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum.  The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa.  Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy.,At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly.  The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator.  A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter.,Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well.,The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers.  The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon.  The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue.  Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure.  Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon.,For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound.  The bone flap was brought on to the field.  The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon.  At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place.  The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses.,Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates.  The wound was then closed in layers.  The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl.

Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position.  Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure.  After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder.  Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum.  An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured.  Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement.  Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate.  Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra.  Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed.  The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted.  After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior.  The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself.  Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature.  The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition.","surgery, carcinoma of the prostate, ablation, cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation, prostate, ultrasound, cryosurgical, urethra, "

Status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor., Surgery, Craniotomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION: , Right-sided craniotomy for evacuation of a right frontal intracranial hemorrhage.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient is very well known to our service.  In brief, the patient is status post orbitozygomatic resection of a pituitary tumor with a very large intracranial component basically a very large skull-based brain tumor.  He was taken to the operating room for the orbitozygomatic approach.  Intraoperatively, everything went well without any complications.  The brain at the end of the procedure was absolutely intact, but the patient developed a seizure in the Intensive Care Unit and then was taken to the CT scan, developed a second seizure.  He was given Ativan for this, and then began to identify a large component measuring about 3 x 3 cm of the right frontal lobe, what appeared to be a hemorrhagic conversion of potential venous infarct.  I had a long discussion immediately with Dr. X and Dr. Y.  We decided to take the patient immediately as a level 1 for evacuation of this hematoma with a small amount of a midline shift with an intraventricular component.  It worried me and I think that we needed to go ahead and take him to the operating room immediately.  The patient was taken as a level 1 immediately and emergently and into the operating room for this procedure.  The original plan was to do first a right-sided orbitozygomatic procedure and then stage it a few weeks later with an endonasal endoscopic procedure for resection of this pituitary tumor component.  He was taken to the operating room for evacuation of a right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Pituitary tumor with a large intracranial component, status post resection and now development of an intracranial hemorrhage.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Intracranial hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe with extension into the intraventricular space after resection of a pituitary tumor via orbitozygomatic approach.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  In the supine position, his head was put in a horseshoe without any complications.  The patient tolerated this very well, and the prior incision was immediately opened.  The surgery had taken place a few hours prior to this, the original orbitozygomatic approach.  At this point, this was a life-saving procedure.  We went ahead, opened the old incision after everything was sterilely prepped, and all the surgical instrumentation was brought into place.  We went ahead and opened the incision and took out the pterional bone flap without any complications.  We immediately opened the dura expeditiously, and the brain was moderately under some pressure, but not really bulging out.  So I went ahead and identified an area over the right frontal lobe that was a little bit consistent with a hemorrhagic infarct and nonviable tissue.  So we went ahead and did a corticectomy right there and identified the actual clot immediately and went ahead, and over the next few hours, very meticulously began to evacuate these clots without any complication whatsoever.  We went all the way down to the ventricle and identified this clot in the ventricle and went ahead and removed this clot without any complications, and we had a very nice resection.  The brain was very relaxed.  We had a very good resection of the actual blood clot, and the brain was very relaxed.  We irrigated thoroughly.  We identified the ventricles.  We went ahead and did a very careful hemostasis with Avitene with thrombin and Gelfoam with thrombin over the next times in doing the procedure.  All this was done very well, and then we lined the cavity with Surgicel, and the Surgicel was only put at the edge and draping down as to not to leave any fragments potentially to communicate with the actual ventricle, and then after this, everything was good.  We went ahead and closed back the actual dura back.  We had done a pericranial flap.  This was also put back in place and the dura was closed with 4-0 Surgilons.  We reconstructed everything.  The frontal sinus was reconstructed thoroughly without any complications.  We went ahead and put once again a watertight closure and went ahead and put another piece of DuraGen with Hemaseel in place, and went ahead and put the bone flap back and reconstructed very nicely once again with self-tapping, self-drilling screws, low-profile plates.  Once everything was confirmed to be in place, we went ahead and closed the muscle flap and also the actual fat pad was put back into place and closed together with 0 pop-offs, and the skin with staples without any complications.  In summary, the procedure was going back to the operating room for evacuation of a right-sided intracranial hemorrhage, most likely a conversion of an intraparenchymal hematoma with extension into the ventricle without any complications.  So everything was stable.  Estimated blood loss was about 100 cubic centimeters.  The sponges and needle counts were correct.  No specimens were sent to pathology.,DISPOSITION: , The patient after this procedure was brought to the Neuro Intensive Care Unit for close observation.","surgery, orbitozygomatic, intracranial, brain tumor, intraparenchymal hematoma, orbitozygomatic approach, frontal lobe, intracranial hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, craniotomy, hemorrhage,"

Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  Table was turned.  The right shoulder roll was placed.  The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut.  The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss.  The parietal boss incision was opened.  It was about an inch and a half in length.  It was carried down to the skull.  Self-retaining retractor was placed.  A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator.  This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch.  The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery.  It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion.  The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges.  There was egress of a large amount of liquid.  Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear.  A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision.  It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture.  The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with staples.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia.  He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition.","surgery, hematoma, burr hole, craniotomy, frontotemporal, frontotemporal craniotomy, subdural, subdural drain, subdural hematoma, subdural space"

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions.","surgery, coronal synostosis, syndromic craniosynostosis, craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, fronto-orbital bar, cranial vault reconstruction, cranial vault, orbital bar, orbital, cranial,"

Placement of overlapping 3.0 x 18 and 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stents in the proximal right coronary artery.,3.  Abdominal aortography.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of exertional dyspnea and a cramping-like chest pain.  Thallium scan has been negative.  He is undergoing angiography to determine if his symptoms are due to coronary artery disease.,NARRATIVE:  ,The right groin was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion and the area of the right coronary artery anesthetized with 2% lidocaine.  Constant sedation was obtained using Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  Received additional Versed and fentanyl during the procedure.  Please refer to the nurses' notes for dosages and timing.,The right femoral artery was entered and a 4-French sheath was placed.  Advancement of the guidewire demonstrated some obstruction at the level of abdominal aorta.  Via the right Judkins catheter, the guidewire was easily infiltrated to the thoracic aorta and over aortic arch.  The right Judkins catheter was advanced to the origin of the right coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.  This revealed a very high-grade lesion at the proximal right coronary artery.  This catheter was exchanged for a left #4 Judkins catheter which was advanced to the ostium of the left main coronary artery where selective angiograms were performed.,The patient was found to have the above mentioned high-grade lesion in the right coronary artery and a coronary intervention was performed.  A 6-French sheath and a right Judkins guide was placed.  The patient was started on bivalarudin.  A BMW wire was easily placed across the lesion and into the distal right coronary artery.  A 3.0 x 15 mm Voyager balloon was placed and deployed at 10 atmospheres.  The intermediate result was improved with TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the vessel.  Following this, a 3.0 x 18 mm Xience stent was placed across the lesion and deployed at 17 atmospheres.  This revealed excellent result however at the very distal of the stent there was an area of haziness but no definite dissection.  This was stented with a 3.0 x 8 mm Xience stent deployed again at 17 atmospheres.  Final angiograms revealed excellent result with TIMI-3 flow at the terminus of the right coronary artery and approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst point of the narrowing.  The guiding catheter was withdrawn over wire and a pigtail was placed.  This was advanced to the abdominal aorta at the area of obstruction and small injection of contrast was given demonstrating that there was a small aneurysm versus a small retrograde dissection in that area with some dye hang up after injection.  The catheter was removed.  The bivalarudin was stopped at the termination of procedure.  A small injection of contrast given through arterial sheath and Angio-Seal was placed without incident.,It should also be noted that an 8-French sheath was placed in the right femoral vein.  This was placed initially as the patient was going to have a right heart catheterization as well because of the dyspnea.,Total contrast media, 205 mL, total fluoroscopy time was 7.5 minutes, X-ray dose, 2666 milligray.,HEMODYNAMICS: , Rhythm was sinus throughout the procedure.  Aortic pressure was 170/81 mmHg.,The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel.  This vessel gives rise to conus branch and two small RV free wall branches and PDA and a small left ventricular branch.  It should be noted that there was competitive flow in the posterior left ventricular branch and that the distal right coronary artery fills via left sided collaterals.  In the proximal right coronary artery, there is a large ulcerative plaque followed immediately by a severe stenosis that is subtotal in severity.  After intervention, there is TIMI-3 flow to the terminus of the right coronary with better fill into the distal right coronary artery and loss of competitive flow.  There was approximately 10% residual stenosis at the worst part of the previous stenosis.,The left main is without disease and trifurcates into a moderate-sized ramus intermedius, the LAD and the circumflex.  The ramus intermedius is free of disease.  The LAD terminates at the LV apex and has elongated area of mild stenosis at its mid segment.  This measures 25% to 30% at its worst point.  The circumflex is a large caliber vessel.  There is a proximal 15% to 20% stenosis and an area of ectasia in the proximal circumflex.  Distally, this circumflex gives rise to a large bifurcating marginal artery and beyond that point, the circumflex is a small vessel within the AV groove.,The aortogram demonstrates eccentric aneurysm formation.  This may represent a small retrograde dissection as well.  There was some dye hang up in the wall.,IMPRESSION,1.  Successful stenting of subtotal stenosis of the proximal coronary artery.,2.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe.  The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized.  The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved.  The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification.  The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively.  The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited.  The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated.  Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff.  The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe.

The patient was advised to have cone biopsy to fully assess endocervical glands.,FINDINGS: , During the examination, under anesthesia, the vulva, vagina, and cervix were grossly unremarkable.  The uterus was smooth with no palpable cervical nodularity and no adnexal masses were noted.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthetic was administered and she was placed in the lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped after which a weighted speculum was placed in the vagina and a tenaculum was placed on the cervix for traction.  Angle stitches of 0 Vicryl sutures were placed at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock in the lateral vagina fornices.  The cervix was stained with Lugol's iodine solution. ,After the cervix was stained, a scalpel was used to excise a cone shaped biopsy circumferentially around the cervical os.  The specimen was removed intact, after which the uterine cavity was sounded to a depth of 8 cm.  A Kevorkian curette was used to obtain endocervical curettings.  The cone biopsy site was sutured using a running lock stitch of 0 Vicryl suture.  Upon completion of the suture placement, the endocervical canal was sounded to assure patency.  A prophylactic application of Monsel's solution completed the procedure.  ,The patient was awakened from her anesthetic and taken to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition.

973, Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture., Surgery, Colonoscopy with Biopsy - 4 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago.  She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes.  She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.,OPERATIVE COURSE:  , The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided.  In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She was noted to have some pools of stool.  This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.,PLAN:,  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.  She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.  Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated.","surgery, colonoscopy with random biopsies, hepatic flexure, topical, culture, antibiotic, hepatic, flexure, diarrhea, biopsies, colonoscopy"

On physical exam, the patient was found to have grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support, and history of hysterectomy.  The patient had good anterior support at the bladder.  Options were discussed such as watchful waiting, pessary, repair with and without mesh, and closing of the vagina (colpocleisis) were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, morbidity, and mortality of the procedure were discussed., ,Risk of infection and abscess formation were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  Risk of retention and incontinence were discussed.  Consent was obtained through the family members.,DETAILS OF THE OR:,  The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed.  The posterior side of the rectocele was visualized with grade 3 rectocele and poor apical support.  A 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was applied for posterior hydrodissection, which was very difficult to do due to the significant scarring of the posterior part.  Attempts were made to lift the vaginal mucosa off of the rectum, which was very, very difficult to do at this point due to the patient's overall poor medical condition in terms of poor mobility and significant scarring.  Discussion was done with the family in the waiting area regarding simply closing the vagina and doing a colpocleisis since the patient is actually inactive.  Family agreed that she is not active and they rather not have any major invasive procedure especially in light of scarring and go ahead and perform the colpocleisis.  Oral consent was obtained from the family and her surgery was preceded.  The vaginal mucosa was denuded off using electrocautery and Metzenbaum scissors.  Using 0 Vicryl, 2 transverse longitudinal stitches were placed to bring the anterior and the posterior part of the vagina together and was started at the apex and was brought all the way out to the introitus.  The vaginal mucosa was pretty much completely closed off all the way up to the introitus.  Indigo carmine was given.  Cystoscopy revealed there was a good efflux of urine from both of the ureteral openings.  There was no injury to the bladder or kinking of the ureteral openings.  The bladder was normal.  Rectal exam was normal at the end of the colpocleisis repair.  There was good hemostasis., ,At the end of the procedure, Foley was removed and the patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition.","surgery, vault prolapse, rectocele repair, rectocele, vaginal mass, metzenbaum scissors, ureteral openings, vaginal mucosa, colpocleisis, vaginal, infection,"

Consideration given to completion thyroidectomy.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure was discussed with the patient in great detail.  Risks included but were not limited to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, injury to nerves including vocal fold paralysis, hoarseness, low calcium, scar, cosmetic deformity, need for thyroid hormone replacement, and also need for further management.  The patient understood all of this and then wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:,  Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Multifocal thyroid carcinoma and previous left thyroid lobectomy resection specimen.,PROCEDURE DETAIL:,  After identifying the patient, the patient was placed supine in the operating room table.  After establishment of general anesthesia via orotracheal intubation with a number 6 nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube, the eyes were protected with Tegaderm.  Nerve integrity monitoring system endotracheal tube was confirmed to be working adequately and secured.  The previous skin incision for a thyroidectomy was then planned, then incorporated into an ellipse.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Subsequently, the ellipse around the previous incision was deformed.  The scar was then excised.  Subplatysmal flaps were raised to the thyroid notch and sternal notch respectively.  Strap muscles were isolated in the midline and dissected and mobilized from the thyroid lobe on the right side.  There was some dense fibrosis and inflammation surrounding the right thyroid lobe.  Careful dissection along the thyroid lobe allowed for identification of the superior thyroid artery and vein which were individually ligated with a Harmonic scalpel.  The right inferior and superior parathyroid glands were identified and preserved and recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and traced superiorly, then preserved.  Of note is that there were multiple lymph nodes in the paratracheal region on the right side.  These lymph nodes were carefully dissected away from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, and the carotid artery, and sent as a separate specimen labeled right paratracheal lymph nodes.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  Valsalva maneuver was given.  Surgicel was placed in the wound bed.  Strap muscles were reapproximated in the midline with 3-0 Vicryl and incision was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and Indermil for the skin.

977," A 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis. ", Surgery, Complex Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease ,"HISTORY:,  The patient is a 10-1/2-year-old born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava, complete atrioventricular septal defect, a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the right-sided atrium, and double-outlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels, the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis.  He had undergone staged repair beginning on 04/21/1997 with a right modified Blalock-Taussig shunt followed on 09/02/1999 with a bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt, and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation.  These procedures were performed at Medical College Hospital.  Family states that they moved to the United States.  Evaluation at the Children's Hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional Glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  He was also found to have elevated Glenn pressures at 22 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmHg.  The QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  A large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated.  The patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the right-sided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle.,Using a 6-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta.  A separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5-French sheath.,Percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted, but unsuccessful.  Ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein.  Using percutaneous technique and a 5-French sheath, 5-French wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left caval-pulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire.  This catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein.  The catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4-French Bernstein catheter, which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava.  A balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery.  There was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right Glenn.  The jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6-French flexor sheath, which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava.  The Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a Terumo guidewire.  Probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery.  The angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis.  The distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length.  The length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultra-thin SD 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist.  This facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis.  A PG 2960 BPX Genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm OptiProbe.  A balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a near-complete disappearance of proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall.  Further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultra-thin SDS 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist.  Angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery.  The balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery.  Bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.  Angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  Angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the OptiProbe 6-mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist.  Repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery.  The proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a PG 2980 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 8-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist.  Distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a PG 1870 BPX Genesis stent premounted on 7-mm OptiProbe balloon catheter.  Repeat angiograms were then performed.  Attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a left-sided azygos vein.  A selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter.  An Amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein.  Once stable device was confirmed, the device was released from the delivery catheter.  The 4-French Bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch, 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein.  A pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins, the innominate vein, superior vena cava, the main pulmonary artery, and azygos vein.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:,  Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation, but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79%.  The pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmHg in 30% oxygen.  Remaining saturations reflected complete admixture.  There was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave somewhat to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 9 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending, descending pressures were similar and normal.  Mean Glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmHg.  The calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a QP:QS ratio of 0.6:1.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 Woods units.  Following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery, there was a slight increase in the Glenn venous pressures to 16 mmHg.  Following embolization of the azygos vein, there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84% and increase in mixed venous saturation.  There was similar increase in Glenn pressures to 28 mmHg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmHg.  There was an increase in arterial pressure.  The calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters /minute/meter squared to 4.3 liters/minute/meter squared.  Angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava.  There appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1-mmHg mean pressure gradient.  There was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery.  Final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right Glenn, a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery, and a widely patent left Glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  Contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.

The problem has been progressive in nature.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included alternative treatment options, the procedure was explained, and the risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patient have less pain and improved function, all questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interfere with normal daily activity.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g of Ancef IV for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was achieved followed by a local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision was made extending from the base of the proximal phalanx fifth digit to a point 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Care was taken to identify and retract all vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  The extensor tendon was identified and retracted medially.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue down to the periosteal layer.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint revealed articular cartilage to be perverse and hypertrophic changes to the lateral and dorsolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head.  An oscillating saw was utilized to carefully resect the hypertrophic portion of the fifth metatarsal head to a more normal configuration.  The both edges were rasped smooth.,Attention was then focused on the fifth metatarsal.  The periosteal layer proximal to the fifth metatarsal head was underscored, free from its underlying attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  An excess guide position perpendicular to the weightbearing surface was placed to define apex of the osteotomy.,Using an oscillating saw, a vertically placed, wedge-shaped oblique ostomy was made with the apex being proximal, lateral, and the base medial and distal.  Generous amounts of lateral cortex were preserved for the lateral hinge.  The wedge was removed from the surgical field.  The fifth metatarsal was placed in the appropriate position and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then countersunk and a 3-0 x 40 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.  Good purchase was noted at the osteotomy site.  Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the fourth intermetatarsal angle with the fifth metatarsal in good alignment and position.  The surgical site was flushed with copious amounts of normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layers were closed with running sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin edges were closed with 4-0 nylon in a running interrupted fashion.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, confirming bandages, and ACE wrap to provide mild compression was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to the recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by normal capillary refill time, and all digits were warm and pink.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear that all the time when standing or walking and be nonweightbearing with crutches and to clear by me.,Office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. t.i.d. for 10 days and Ultram ER, #15 one p.o. daily along with written and oral home instructions including a number on which I can be reached 24 hours a day if any problem arises.,After short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with a vital sign stable in no acute distress.","surgery, internal screw fixation, osteotomy, closing wedge osteotomy, tailor's bunion, screw fixation, periosteal layer, metatarsal head, wedge osteotomy, metatarsal, anesthesia"
1013," Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta, dilated cardiomyopathy, bicuspid aortic valve, patent foramen ovale.", Surgery, Coarctation of Aorta ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 4-month-old who presented with respiratory distress and absent femoral pulses with subsequent evaluation including echocardiogram that demonstrated severe coarctation of the aorta with a peak gradient of 29 mmHg and associated dilated cardiomyopathy with fractional shortening of 16%.  A bicuspid aortic valve was also seen without insufficiency or stenosis.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization for balloon angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta.,PROCEDURE:  ,After sedation and general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a percutaneous technique a 4-French 8 cm long double lumen central venous catheter was inserted in the left femoral vein and sutured into place.  There was good blood return from both the ports.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch of pulmonary arteries.  The atrial septum was not probe patent.,Using a 4-French sheath a 4-French marker pigtail catheter was inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ,ascending aorta and left ventricle.  A descending aortogram demonstrated discrete coarctation of the aorta approximately 8 mm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  The transverse arch measured 5 mm.  Isthmus measured 4.7 mm and coarctation measured 2.9 x 1.8 mm at the descending aorta level.  The diaphragm measured 5.6 mm.  The pigtail catheter was exchanged for a wedge catheter, which was then directed into the right innominate artery.  This catheter was exchanged over a wire for a Tyshak mini 6 x 2 cm balloon catheter which was advanced across the coarctation and inflated with complete disappearance of discrete waist.  Pressure pull-back following angioplasty, however, demonstrated a residual of 15-20 mmHg gradient.  Repeat angiogram showed mild improvement in degree of aortic narrowing.  The angioplasty was then performed using a Tyshak mini 7 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of mild waist.  The pigtail catheter was then reintroduced for a pressure pull-back measurement and final angiogram.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption.,Cineangiograms were obtained with injection in the descending aorta.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to mild systemic arterial desaturation and anemia.  There is no evidence of significant intracardiac shunt.  Further the heart was desaturated due to VQ mismatch.,Phasic right-sided pressures were normal as was the right pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure with the A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was mildly increased with a 60 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and a 29 mmHg systolic gradient on pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated flows were mildly increased.  Vascular resistances were normal.  A cineangiogram with contrast injection in the descending aorta showed a normal left aortic arch with normal origins of the brachiocephalic vessels.  There is discrete juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.  Flow within the intercostal arteries was retrograde.  Following balloon angioplasty of coarctation of the aorta, there was slight fall in the mixed venous saturation and an increase in systemic arterial saturation as the fall in left ventricular systolic pressure from 99 mmHg to 92 mmHg.  There remained a 4 mmHg systolic gradient into the ascending aorta and 9 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the descending aorta.  The calculated systemic flow fell to normal values.  Final angiogram with injection in the descending aorta demonstrated improved caliber of coarctation of the aorta with mild intimal irregularity and a small left lateral filling defect consistent with a small intimal tear in the region of the ductus arteriosus.  There is brisk flow in the descending aorta and appropriate flow in the intercostal arteries.  The narrowest diameter of the aorta measured 4.9 x 4.2 mm.,DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Juxtaductal coarctation of the aorta.,2.  Dilated cardiomyopathy.,3.  Bicuspid aortic valve.,4.  Patent foramen ovale.,INTERVENTION: , Balloon dilation of coarctation of the aorta.,MANAGEMENT: , The case will be discussed at combined Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference.  The patient will be allowed to recover from the current intervention with the hopes of complete left ventricular function recovery.  The patient will undoubtedly require formal coarctation of the aorta repair surgically in 4-6 months.  The further cardiologic care will be directed by Dr. X.","surgery, coarctation, juxtaductal, dilated cardiomyopathy, bicuspid aortic valve, patent foramen ovale, catheter was inserted, mmhg systolic gradient, mmhg systolic, systolic gradient, descending aorta, catheterization, mmhg, ventricular, aorta, aortic, foramen,"

Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus.,2.  Tethered brachial artery, left elbow.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital.  A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.,PROCEDURE: , After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed.,The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department.  Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner.  Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly.  Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out.  The elbow was hyperflexed.  Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve.  The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm.,After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally.  Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital.  He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally.  This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler.  A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler.  Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______.  A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery.  Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this.  I then came back in and then we proceeded.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery.  There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally.  Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses.,We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed.  The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position.  He was splinted posteriorly.

Placement of VAC negative pressure wound dressing.,INDICATIONS: , This 3-year-old male suffered amputation of his left upper extremity with complications of injury.  He presents at this time for further attempts at closure.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , A clean wound to left upper extremity with partial dehiscence of previously closed wounds and also the closure was satisfactory.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , Under inhalational anesthesia, he was prepped and draped in usual fashion exposing left upper extremity and also exposing continuity of the left abdomen, chest, and groin.  He underwent systematic evaluation of his wound of his left upper extremity and we excised first the whole wound prior to doing some additional closure.  Some areas were dehisced and appeared to be because it was approximation of granulation tissue and as a result the edges were freshened up prior to approximating them.  In this fashion, simple closure was accomplished and its total length was approximately 8 cm.  It should be noted that prior to doing any procedure that appropriate timeout was performed and he received prophylactic antibiotics as indicated and did not require DVT prophylaxis.  At this time, once we accomplished debridement and simple closure removing skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle and bone as well as closing the arm, we could design our flap for the abdomen.  The flap was designed as a slightly greater than 1:1 ellipse of skin from just below the costal margin.  This was elevated at the level of the external oblique and then laid on the left forearm.  The donor's site was closed using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl in the deep dermis and running subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl on the skin.  Steri-Strips were applied.  At this time, the flap was inset using again 4-0 Monocryl sutures and then ultimately the VAC negative pressure wound dressing was applied to help hold this in place and optimize the vascularization of the flap.

The patient has undergone cleft lip repair, and she is here today for her cleft palate operation.  We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits; the risks included but not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, the need for future revision surgeries.  We will proceed with surgery.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position, and general anesthetic was administered.  A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given.  The patient proceeded to have bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X, from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery.  After he was done with his procedure, the head of the bed was turned 90 degrees.  The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut.  A Dingman retractor was placed.  The operative area was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, a total of 3 mL, and then, I proceeded with the prepping and draping.  The patient was prepped and draped.  I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications.  BSS is applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm.  I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.  The sponge, needle, and instrument count were completed at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure without complications and was transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.","surgery, bilateral cleft, cleft lip, oral mucosa, hard palate, soft palate, vomer flaps, mucoperiosteal flap, nasal mucosa, flaps, cleft, mucosa, palate, mucoperiosteal, bilateral, nasal,"

There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed.  There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall.  The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell.  The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room.  At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint.  After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care.,PROCEDURE:  ,After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained.  The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient.  This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes.  Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle.  A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.  Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified.  The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site.  The wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position.  There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone.  It was held in place with reduction forceps.  A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation.  It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula.  Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each.  The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length.  Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole.  The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length.  Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position.  There was no lateralization of the joints.  Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle.  Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus.  Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site.  The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures.  Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum.  The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus.  There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies.  Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire.  Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length.  These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position.  Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws.  They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint.  At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin.  A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril.  A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity.  This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing.  At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.","surgery, ankle fracture, dislocation, open reduction, internal fixation, orif, trimalleolar ankle fracture, cortical screw, cancellous screws, fracture site, fracture, ankle, malleolus, "

After anesthesia was administered, time out was taken to ensure correct patient, procedure, and site.  The face was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The right ear tag was examined first.  This was a small piece of skin and cartilaginous material protruding just from the tragus.  The lesion was excised and injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and then excised using an elliptical-style incision.  Dissection was carried down the subcutaneous tissue to remove any cartilaginous attachment to the tragus.  After this was done, the wound was cauterized and then closed using interrupted 5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was then turned towards the palate.  The Dingman mouthgag was inserted and the palate was injected with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine.  After giving this 5 minutes to take effect, the palate was incised along its margins.  The anterior oral mucosa was lifted off and held demonstrating the underlying levator muscle.  Muscle was freed up from its attachments at the junction of the hard palate and swept down so that it will be approximated across the midline.  The Z-plasties were then designed, so there would be opposing Z-plasties from the nasal mucosa compared to the oral mucosa.  The nasal mucosa was sutured first using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  Next, the muscle was reapproximated using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl with an attempt to overlap the muscle in the midline.  In addition, the remnant of the uvula tissue was found and was sutured in such a place that it would add some extra bulk to the nasal surface of the palate.  Following this, the oral layer of mucosa was repaired using an opposing Z-plasty compared to the nasal layer.  This was also sutured in place using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.

After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis.  At this point, we probed both urethral meatus.  Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus.  At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter.  We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful.  We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication.  At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors.  We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans.,At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee.  Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision.  Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans.

The patient was brought to the cardiac cath suite.  Right groin was prepped in usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated with the modified Seldinger technique.  A 6-French sheath was introduced.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary artery and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an EBU 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in several views and it was noted to have a 99% proximal left circumflex stenosis.  Angiomax bolus and drip were started after checking an ACT, which was 180, and an Universal wire was advanced through the left circumflex beyond the lesion.  Next, a 3.0 x 12 mm balloon was used to pre-dilate the lesion.  Next a 3.5 x 12 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to the area of stenosis and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  There was noted to be a plaque shift proximally at the edge of the stent.  Therefore, a 3.5 x 8 mm Vision bare-metal stent was advanced to cover the proximal margin of the first stent and deployed at 12 atmospheres.  Next, a 3.75 x 13 mm noncompliant balloon was advanced into the margin of the stent and two inflations at 20 atmospheres were done for 20 seconds.  Final images showed excellent results with initial 99% stenosis reduced to 0%.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the mid to distal in the OM branch.  At this point, wire was removed.  Final images confirmed initial stent results, no evidence of dissection, perforation, or complications.,Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressure was measured.  LV gram was done in both the LAO and RAO projections and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Finally, all guides were removed.

The patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite.  The right groin was prepped in the usual sterile fashion.  Right common femoral artery was cannulated using a modified Seldinger technique and a long 6-French AO sheath was introduced secondary to tortuous aorta.  Next, Judkins left catheter was used to engage the left coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, Judkins right catheter was used to engage the right coronary system.  Cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, the Judkins right catheter was used to engage the SVG to OM.  Cineangiography was recorded.  Next, the Judkins right was advanced into the left subclavian and exchanged over a long exchange length J-wire for a 4-French left internal mammary artery which was used to engage the LIMA graft to LAD and cineangiography was recorded in multiple views.  Next, an angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the left ventricular cavity.  LV pressures were measured.  LV gram was done and a pullback gradient across the aortic valve was done and recorded.  Next, an aortogram was done and recorded.  At this point, I decided to proceed with percutaneous intervention of the left circumflex.  Therefore, AVA 3.5 guide was used to engage the left coronary artery.  Angiomax bolus and drip was started.  Universal wire was advanced past the lesion and a 2.5-balloon was advanced first to the proximal lesions and predilations were done at 14 atmospheres and then to the distal lesion and predilatation was done at 12 atmospheres.  Next, we attempted to advance a 3.0 x 12 stent to the distal lesion; however, we were unable to pass the stent.  Next, second dilatations were done again with the 2.5 balloon at 18 atmospheres; however, we are unable to break the lesion.  We next attempted a cutting balloon.  Again, we are unable to cross the lesion, therefore a buddy wire technique was used with a PT choice support wire.  Again, we were unable to cross the lesion with the stent.  We then try to cross with a noncompliant balloon, which we were unsuccessful.  We also try to cutting balloon again, we were unsuccessful.  Despite multiple dilatations, we were unable to cross anything beyond the noncompliant balloon across the lesion; therefore, finally the procedure was aborted.  Final images showed no evidence of dissection, perforation, or further complication.  The right groin was filled after taking an image to confirm sheath placement above the bifurcation with excellent results.  The patient tolerated the procedure very well without complications, was taken off the operating table and transferred back to cardiac telemetry floor.,DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS,1.  The LV.  LVEDP was 4.  LVES is approximately 50%-55% with inferobasal hypokinesis.  No significant MR. No gradient across the aortic valve.,2.  Aortogram.  The ascending aorta shows no significant dilatation or evidence of dissection.  The valve shows no significant aortic insufficiencies.  The abdominal aorta and distal aorta shows significant tortuosities.,3.  The left main.  The left main coronary artery is a large caliber vessel, bifurcating the LAD and left circumflex with some mild distal disease of about 10%-20%.,4.  Left circumflex.  The left circumflex vessel is a large caliber vessel gives off a distal branching obtuse marginal branch.  The upper pole of the OM shows retrograde filling of the distal graft and also at that point approximately a 70%-80% stenosis.  The mid left circumflex is a high-grade 80% diffuse tortuous stenosis.,5.  LAD.  The LAD is a totally 100% occluded vessel.  The LIMA to LAD is patent with only a small-to-moderate caliber LAD.  There is a large diagonal branch coming off the proximal portion of the LAD and that proximal LAD showed some diffuse disease upwards of 60%-70%.  The diagonal shows proximal 80% stenosis.,6.  The right coronary artery:  The right coronary artery is 100% occluded.  There are retrograde collaterals from left to right to the distal PDA and PLV branches.  The SVG to OM is 100% occluded at its take off.  The SVG to PDA is not found; however, presumed 100% occluded given that there is collateral flow to the distal right.,7.  LIMA to LAD is widely patent.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Attempted intervention to the left circumflex system, only able to perform plano balloon angioplasty, unable to pass stents, noncompliant balloons or cutting balloon.  Final images showed some improvement, however, continued residual stenosis.  At this point, the patient will be transferred back to telemetry floor and monitored.  We can attempt future intervention or continue aggressive medical management.  The patient continues to have residual stenosis in the diagonal; however, due to the length of this procedure, I did not attempt intervention to that diagonal branch.  Possible consideration would be a stress test as an outpatient depending on where patient shows ischemia, focus on treatment to that lesion.","surgery, coronary system cineangiography, svg to om, lima to lad, ventriculogram, aortogram, percutaneous intervention, circumflex, obtuse marginal branch, balloon angioplasty, coronary artery, balloon, cineangiography, lad,"

These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.,Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.

Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.,The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.,Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.,The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, gangrenous, cholecystectomy, laparoscopic, gallbladder, blake, omentum, hasson, electrocautery, gallbladder fossa, endotracheal, subhepatic, french, "

The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken.

Chest x-ray and CT scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening.  A biopsy was performed at an outside hospital (Kaiser) and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma.  The patient had a metastatic workup, which was negative including a brain MRI and bone scan.  The bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor.  The patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease, hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes, longstanding atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  He and his family were apprised of the high-risk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  The patient was intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  A Foley catheter was placed.  The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib.  A thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space.  Inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions, which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection.  The thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly.  It was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor, approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected.  The ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect.  The ribs 7, 8, 9, and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips.  The chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly.  It was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement.  Inferiorly, the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor.  The spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.  Inferiorly, the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace.  The dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine.  The left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the GIA 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe, which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung.  A 2-0 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection.  Posteriorly, the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately T8 and T9, where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies.  The ribs were disarticulated, closed to or at their articulations with the spine.  Bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery.  There was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta.,The posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section.  The specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figure-of-8 #1 Ethibond sutures.  This produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension.  A single 32-French chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly.  This was secured with a #1 silk suture.  The Gore-Tex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect.  A series of #1 Prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually.  The resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate.  The serratus muscle was reapproximated with figure-of-8 0 Vicryl.  The latissimus was reapproximated with a two #1 Vicryl placed in running fashion.  Of note, two #10 JP drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl.  The wounds were dressed.  The patient was brought from the operating room directly to the North ICU, intubated in stable condition.

Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall.  The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain.  Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised.  Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia.  Fascia was opened vertically.  Stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.,Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left.  A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes.  Liver was grossly normal.  Gallbladder was noted to be thickened.  Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.,The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated.  It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal.  There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted.  It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly.  The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips.  Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.,The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port.  Specimen was sent for histopathology.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2.  Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect.  Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat.  In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory.  Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.,The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, cholelithiasis, acute cholecystitis, laparoscopic, cholecystectomy, cholangiogram, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, gallbladder,"

The patient was in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,The area of the mass, which was on the anterior lower ribs on the left side was marked and then a local anesthetic was injected.  An incision was made directly on the mass and carried down to the ribs.  This is where the several chondral cartilages of the lower ribs meet.  So I believe they were isolated in 9th rib anteriorly and I was able to encircle it.  The medial area was __________.  There was no way to perform same procedure there, so what I did, I took an electric saw and proceeded to divide the calcified cartilages of the sternum and also the attachments to the lower ribs.  There was also a separate sharp growth of the mass growing superiorly.  Apparently, I was able to excise the mass and actually it was much larger than it was palpated externally.  This may be due to an extension towards the inside of his chest.  Hemostasis was revised.  The internal mammary was intact and there was no obvious penetration of the pleural cavity.  The specimen was sent to Pathology and then we proceeded to close the defect.  Obviously, the space between the ribs cannot be approximated.  So what we did was approximate the pectoralis major operative defect and then the soft tissues and the skin with subcuticular suture of Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Extensive anterior abdominal wall adhesions with the anterior abdominal wall completely adhered to the anterior uterus throughout its entire length of the incision.  In addition, the bladder was involved in adhesion mass complex.  A window was developed surgically at the apical aspect of the incision enabling finger to pass to get behind the dense anterior abdominal wall adhesions.  These adhesions were surgically transected using Bovie cautery technique freeing up the anterior uterine attachment from the anterior abdominal wall.  Upon initial entry through the fibrous layer of the anterior abdominal wall _______ into the serosal and slightly muscular part of the anterior uterus due to the dense adhesion attachment that had occurred from previous surgeries.

She was prepped and draped in the usual manner for repeat cesarean section.  A sharp knife was used to make a Pfannenstiel skin incision at the site of the previous scar.  This was carried through the subcutaneous tissue into the dense fibromuscular and fascial layer with a sharp knife.  This incision was extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  Dense fibromuscular layer was encountered from the patient's previous surgeries.  Upon entry, incision was entered into the serosal and partial muscular layer of the anterior uterus and there was no free area to enter into the peritoneal cavity due to dense fibromuscular adhesions of the entire uterus to the anterior abdominal wall at the length of the incision.  Fascia was previously separated superiorly and inferiorly from the muscular layer.  A surgical window was created at the apical aspect of the incision in the direction of the uterine fundus.  Finger was able to be passed and placed behind the dense adhesions between the uterus through anterior abdominal wall.  This adhesion complex was transacted via Bovie cautery its entire length circumferentially freeing the uterus from its attachment to anterior abdominal wall.  Inferiorly, difficulty was encountered with adhesion separation involving the bladder additionally to the uterus and the anterior abdominal wall.  These adhesions likewise were surgically transacted via sharp, blunt, and electrocautery dissection.  This was successfully done without anterior entry into the bladder.  Smooth pickups and Metzenbaum scissors were then used to do sharp dissection to separated the bladder from its attachment to the lower uterine segment enabling the vesicouterine peritoneal reflection for incision of the uterus.  The uterus was then incised using a sharp knife and low transverse incision.  This was extended with bandage scissors.  The infant was delivered easily from a cephalic presentation.  Bulb suction was done following delivery of the head and body.  The cord clamped and cut and the infant passed to pediatric team present.  Cord segment and cord blood was obtained.  Complete placenta manually extracted intact with three vessel cord.  Vigorous male infant, Apgars 9/9, weight 6 pounds 14 ounces.  Complete placenta with three vessels retrieved.  Uterus was exteriorized from the abdominal cavity.  Wet lap applied to the fundus and dry lap used to remove the remaining membranous tissue from the lining.  Pennington clamps placed at the uterine incision angles and the inferior incision lip.  A #1 chromic suture closed the uterus in running continuous interlocking closure.  Good hemostasis upon completion of the closure.  Laparotomy pads placed in the posterior cul-de-sac to remove any blood or clots.  The uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity, after using #1 chromic suture to close the anterior uterine incision, that was partial thickness through the serosal end of the muscular layer at midline adhesion.  This was closed with chromic suture in a running continuous interlocking closure with good hemostasis.  Attention was then focused on the bilateral tubal ligation.  Babcock clamp placed in the mid fallopian tube and elevated.  Cautery was used to make a window in the avascular segment of the mesosalpinx.  Proximal and distal #1 chromic suture ligation with mid fallopian tube transection performed.  The ligated proximal and distal stumps were then cauterized with Bovie cautery.  This tubal ligation procedure was done in a bilateral fashion.  Upon completion of tubal ligation, uterus was returned to the abdominal cavity.  Left and right gutters examined and found to be clean and dry.  Evaluation of the low uterine segment incision revealed continued hemostasis.  Oozing was encountered in the inferior bladder of dissection and 2-0 chromic suture in running continuous fashion, partial thickness of the bladder to control the oozing at this site was successfully done.  Interceed was then placed on the low uterine incision and the low anterior uterine aspect.  The midline rectus including peritoneum was re-approximated with simple interrupted chromic sutures.

Stemmed tibial component, size 2.,5.  Palacos cement with antibiotics x2 batches.,INDICATION: , The patient is an 84-year-old female with significant endstage osteoarthritis of the left knee, who has had rapid progression with pain and disability.  Surgery was indicated to relieve her pain and improve her functional ability.  Goal objectives and the procedure were discussed with the patient.  Risks and benefits were explained.  No guarantees have been made or implied.  Informed consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and once an adequate spinal anesthesia with Duramorph was achieved, her left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed proximally in the thigh.  Antibiotics were infused prior to Foley catheter insertion.  Time-out procedure was called.,A straight longitudinal anterior midline incision was made.  Dissection was carried down sharply down the skin, subcutaneous tissue and the fascia.  Deep fascia was exposed.  The tourniquet was inflated at 300 mmHg prior to the skin incision.  A standard medial parapatellar approach was made.  The quadriceps tendon was incised approximately 1 cm from the vastus medialis insertion.  Incision was then carried down distally and distal arthrotomy was completed.  Patellar tendon was well protected.  Retinaculum and capsule was incised approximately 5 mm from the medial border of the patella for later repair.  The knee was exposed very well.  Significant tricompartmental osteoarthritis was noted.  The osteophytes were removed with a rongeur.  Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were excised.  Medial and lateral meniscectomies were performed.  Medial dissection was performed subperiosteally along the medial aspect of the proximal tibia to address the varus deformity.  The medial compartment was more affected than lateral.  Medial ligaments were tied.  Retropatellar fat pad was excised.  Osteophytes were removed.  Using a Cobb elevator, the medial soft tissue periosteum envelope was well reflected.,Attention was placed for the preparation of the femur.  The trochlear notch was ossified.  A rongeur was utilized to identify the notch and then using an intramedullary drill guide, a starting hole was created slightly anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior portal was 1 cm anterior to the PCL attachment.  The anterior femoral sizer was positioned keeping 3 degrees of external rotation.  Rotation was also verified using the transepicondylar axis and Whiteside line.  The pins were positioned in the appropriate holes.  Anterior femoral cut was performed after placing the cutting guide.  Now, the distal cutting guide was attached to the alignment and 5 degrees of valgus cut was planned.  A distal femoral cut was made which was satisfactory.  A sizer was positioned which was noted to be D.  The 5-in-1 cutting block size D was secured with spring pins over the resected bone.  Using an oscillating saw, cuts were made in a sequential manner such as anterior condyle, posterior condyle, anterior chamfer, and posterior chamfer.  Then using a reciprocating saw, intercondylar base notch cut and side cuts were made.  Following this, the cutting block for High-Flex knee was positioned taking 2 mm of additional posterior condyle.  Using a reciprocating saw, the side cuts were made and bony intercondylar notch cut was completed.  The bone with its attached soft tissue was removed.  Once the femoral preparation was completed, attention was placed for the preparation of the tibia.  The medial and the lateral collateral ligaments were well protected with a retractor.  The PCL retractor was positioned and the tibia was translated anteriorly.  Osteophytes were removed.  The extramedullary tibial alignment guide was affixed to the tibia and appropriate amount of external rotation was considered reference to the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  Similarly, horseshoe alignment guide was positioned and the alignment guide was well aligned to the distal 1/3rd of the crest of the tibia as well as the 2nd toe.  Once the alignment was verified in a coronal plane, the tibial EM guide was well secured and then posterior slope was also aligned keeping the alignment rod parallel to the tibial crest.  A built-in 7-degree posterior slope was considered with instrumentation.  Now, the 2 mm stylus arm was positioned over the cutting block medially, which was the most affected site.  Tibial osteotomy was completed 90 degrees to the mechanical axis in the coronal plane.  The resected thickness of the bone was satisfactory taken 2 mm from the most affected site.  The resected surface shows some sclerotic bone medially.  Now, attention was placed for the removal of the posterior osteophytes from the femoral condyle.  Using curved osteotome, angle curette, and a rongeur, the posterior osteophytes were removed.  Now, attention was placed for confirming the flexion-extension gap balance using a 10 mm spacer block in extension and 12 mm in flexion.  Rectangular gap was achieved with appropriate soft tissue balance in both flexion and extension.  The 12 mm spacer block was satisfactory with good stability in flexion and extension.,Attention was now placed for completion of the tibia.  Size 2 tibial trial plate was positioned.  Appropriate external rotation was maintained with the help of the horseshoe alignment rod.  Reference to the tibial crest distally and 2nd toe was considered as before.  The midpoint of the trial tray was collinear with the medial 1/3rd of the tibial tubercle.  The rotation of tibial plate was satisfactory as required and the preparation of the tibia was completed with intramedullary drill followed by broach impactor.  At this point, trial femoral and tibial components were reduced using a 12 mm trial liner.  The range of motion and stability in both flexion and extension was satisfactory.  No further soft tissue release was indicated.  I was able to achieve 0 degrees of extension and complete flexion of the knee.,Attention was now placed for the preparation of the patella.  Using a patellar caliper, the thickness was measured to be 21.5 mm.  This gives an ideal resection of 8.5 mm keeping 13 mm of bone intact.  Reaming was initiated with a patellar reamer reaming up to 13 mm with the reaming alignment guide.  Using a caliper, the resected patella was measured, which was noted to be 13 mm.  A 32 sizer was noted to accommodate the resected surface very well.  Drilling was completed and trial 32 button was inserted without any difficulty.  The tracking was satisfactory.  There was no evidence of any subluxation or dislocation of the patella.  The trial components position was satisfactory.  The alignment and the rotation of all 3 components were satisfactory.  All the trial components were removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with Pulsavac lavage irrigation mechanical system.  The resected surfaces were dried with a sponge.  Two batches of Palacos cement were mixed.  The cementing was initiated starting with tibia followed by femur and patella.  Excess peripheral cement were removed with the curette and knife.  The knee was positioned in extension with a 12 mm trial liner.  Patellar clamp was placed after cementing the all-poly patella.  Once the cement was set hard and cured, tourniquet was deflated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The trial 12 mm liner was replaced with definitive Prolong highly cross-linked polyethylene liner.  Range of motion and stability was verified at 0 degrees and flexion of 120 degrees.  Anterior-posterior drawer test was satisfactory.  Medial and lateral stability was satisfactory.  Patellar tracking was satisfactory.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  A local cocktail was injected, which included the mixture of 0.25% plain Marcaine, 30 mg of Toradol, and 4 mg of morphine.  The quadriceps mechanism and distal arthrotomy was repaired with #1 Vicryl in figure-of-8 fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl and 0 Vicryl followed by 2-0 Vicryl proximally.  The skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed including Xeroform, 4x4, ABD, and Bias.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.  She tolerated the procedure very well.",

Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made.  Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps.  A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02.  Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant.  There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel.  The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve.  This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice.  The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal.  The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye.  There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp.  The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table.  The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear.  I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon.  This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined.  There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear.  The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution.  There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery.  The trocars were removed under direct vision.  No bleeding was noted.  The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.","surgery, polyp, laparoscopic resection, blunt dissection, kocher clamps, ileocecal valve, gia stapler, peritoneal cavity, cecal polyp, infiltrated, anesthetic "

The lesser trochanter was intact.  The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration.  The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone.  The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment.  Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture.  She denied any history of fall or trauma.  The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment.  Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed.  Treatment options were reviewed.  No guarantees have been made or implied.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  Time-out procedure was called.  Antibiotics were infused.,A standard posterolateral approach was made.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus.  This was then incised along the line of the incision.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Charnley retractor was positioned.  The trochanter was intact.  The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor.  The piriformis and minimus junction was identified.  The minimus was also reflected along with the medius.  Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion.  Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed.  A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair.  Fracture site was exposed.  The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type.  Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew.  The head size was measured to be 43 mm.  Bony fragments were removed.  The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated.  A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability.  The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration.  This was sent to the pathology.  The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem.  An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis.  The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter.  There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter.  The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder.  The fracture site was well exposed.  Satisfactory lateralization was performed.  Attention was for the reaming process.  Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal.  At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted.  Appropriate anteversion was positioned.  The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation.  The bony edges were trimmed.  The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well.  There was no evidence of any subsidence.  At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length.  The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory.  The hip was well reduced without any difficulty.  The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory.  The shuck was less than 1 mm.  Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg.  Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation.  Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees.  After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed.  The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely.  At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed.  The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected.  Centralizer was positioned.  The cement restrictor was inserted.  Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried.  Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed.  The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured.  The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator.  All the cement debris was removed.,Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head.  Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion.  It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory.  I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal.  The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation.  There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation.  I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable.  At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced.  Range of motion and stability was as above.  Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis.  This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster.  Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl.  The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures.  Skin was approximated with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed.  Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications noted.",

The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis.  Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery.  The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia.  The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.,The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  After the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.,The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction.  The scope was then further removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , The patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris.  At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma.  If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia.  The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems.","surgery, laryngeal, inhaled steroid use, dry nasal mucosa, fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy, nasal mucosa, atrophic, cauterization, mucosa, supraglottic, laryngoscope, fiberoptic, dysphonia, lesions, epistaxis,"

This provided local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The total of Lidocaine used throughout the procedure was maintained at no more than 500mg.,SUBMENTAL SUCTION ASSISTED LIPECTOMY: , The incision was made, as previously outlined, in the submental crease in a transverse direction, through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery.  A Metzenbaum scissors was used to elevate the area in the submental region for about 2 or 3cm and making radial tunnels from the angle of the mandible all the way to the next angle of the mandible.  4mm liopsuction cannula was then introduced along these previously outlined tunnels into the jowl on both sides and down top the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid laterally and just past the thyroid notch interiorly.  The tunnels were enlarged with a 6mm flat liposuction cannula.,Then with the Wells-Johnson liposuction machine 27-29 inches of underwater mercury suction was accomplished in all tunnels.  Care was taken not to turn the opening of the suction cannula up to the dermis, but it was rotated in and out taking a symmetrical amount of fat from each area.  A similar procedure was performed with the 4 mm cannula cleaning the area.  Bilateral areas were palpated for symmetry, and any remaining fat was then suctioned directly.,A triangular wedge of anterior platysma border was cauterized and excised at the cervical mental angle.  A plication stitch of 3-0 Vicryl was placed.,When a satisfactory visible result had been accomplished from the liposuction, the inferior flap was then advanced over anteriorly and the overlying skin excised in an incremental fashion.  5-0 plain catgut was used for closure in a running interlocking fashion.  The wound was cleaned at the end, dried, and Mastisol applied.  Then tan micropore tape was placed for support to the entire area.,FACE LIFT: , After waiting approximately 10-15 minutes for adequate vasoconstriction the post auricular incision was started at the earlobe and continued up on the posterior aspect of the ear for approximately 2cm just superior to the external auditory canal.  A gentle curve was then made, and again the incision was carried down to and into the posterior hairline paralleling the hair follicles and directed posteriorly towards the occipital region.  A preauricular incision was carried into the natural crease superior to the tragus, curved posterior to the tragus bilaterally then brought out inferiorly in the natural crease between the lobule and preauricular skin.  The incision was made in the temporal area beveling parallel with the hair follicles.  (The incision had been designed with curve underneath the sideburn in order to maintain the sideburn hair locations and then curved posteriorly.),The plane of dissection in the hairbearing area was kept deep to the roots of the hair follicles and superficial to the fascia of the temporalis muscle and sternocleidomastoid.  The dissection over the temporalis muscle was continued anteriorly towards the anterior hairline and underneath the frontalis to the supraorbital rim.  At the superior level of the zygoma and at the level of the sideburn, dissection was brought more superficially in order to avoid the nerves and vessels in the areas, specifically the frontalis branch of the facial nerve.,The facial flaps were then elevated with both blunt and sharp dissection with the Kahn facelift dissecting scissors in the post auricular region to pass the angle of the mandible.  This area of undermining was connected with an area of undermining starting with the temporal region extending in the preauricular area of the cheek out to the jowl.  Great care was taken to direct the plane of dissecting superficial to the parotid fascia or SMAS.  The entire dissection was carried in a radial fashion from the ear for approximately 4cm at the lateral canthal area to 8-10cm in the neck region.  When the areas of dissection had been connected carefully, hemostasis was obtained and all areas inspected.  At no point were muscle fibers or major vessels or nerves encountered in the dissection.,The SMAS was sharply incised in a semilunar fashion in front of the ear and in front of the anterior border of the SCM.  The SMAS flap was then advanced posteriorly and superiorly.  The SMAS was split at the level of the earlobe, and the inferior portion was sutured to the mastoid periosteum.  The excess SMAS was trimmed and excised from the portion anterior to the auricle.  The SMAS was then imbricated with 2-0 Surgidak interrupted sutures.,The area was then inspected for any bleeding points and careful hemostasis obtained.  The flaps were then rotated and advanced posteriorly and then superiorly, and incremental cuts were made and the suspension points in the pre and post auricular area were done with 2-0 Tycron suture.  The excess and redundant amount of skin were then excised and trimmed cautiously so as not to cause any downward pull on the ear lobule or any stretching of the scars in the healing period.  Skin closure was accomplished in the hairbearing areas with 5-0 Nylon in the preauricular tuft and 4-0 Nylon interrupted in the post auricular area.  The pre auricular area was closed first with 5-0 Dexon at the ear lobules, and 6-0 Nylon at the lobules, and 5-0 plain catgut in a running interlocking fashion.  5-0 Plain catgut was used in the post auricular area as well, leaving ample room for serosanguinous drainage into the dressing.  The post tragal incisin was closed with interrupted and running interlocking 5-0 plain catgut.  The exact similar procedure was repeated on the left side.,At the end of this procedure, all flaps were inspected for adequate capillary filling or any evidence of hematoma formation.  Any small amount of fluid was expressed post-auricularly.  A fully perforated bulb suction drain was placed under the flap and exited posterior to the hairline on each side prior to the suture closure.  A Bacitracin impregnated nonstick dressing was cut to conform to the pre and post auricular area and placed over the incision lines.,ABD padding over 4X4 gauze was used to cover the pre and post auricular areas.  This was wrapped around the head in a vertical circumferential fashion and anchored with white micropore tape in a non-constricting but secured fashion.  The entire dressing complex was secured with a pre-formed elastic stretch wrap device.  All branches of the facial nerve were checked and appeared to be functioning normally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to home in satisfactory condition.","surgery, neck skin ptosis, lipotosis, rhytides, facelift, submental suction assisted lipectomy, pre and post auricular, cheek neck facelift, auricular region, neck facelift, cheek neck, post auricular, auricular, incision, postoperative, cheek, submental, dissection, neck, "

The patient was taken to the operative suite and administered anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion.  A #15 French Foley catheter was inserted under sterile conditions.  Incision was made in the left base of the penile shaft on the lateral aspect, approximately 3 cm in length.  Tissue was dissected down to the level of the corpora cavernosum and corpora spongiosum.  The fascia was incised in elliptical fashion for approximately 2 cm.  A #14 gauge Angiocath was inserted into the corpora cavernosum to the glans of the penis and the corpora was irrigated copiously until all of the old clotted blood was removed and fresher irrigation was noted.,Attention was then turned to the left groin and the superficial saphenous vein was harvested.  Due to incisions brought up into the initial incision after gauging enough length, this was then spatulated with Potts scissors for approximately 2 cm.  Vein was irrigated.  One branching vessel was noted to be leaking, this was tied off and repeat injection with heparinized saline showed no additional leaks.  Tunnel was then created from the superior most groin region to the incision in the penile shaft.  Saphenous vein was then passed through this tunnel with the aid of a hemostat.  Anastomosis was performed using #5-0 Prolene suture in a running fashion from proximal to distal.  There were no leaks noted.  There was good flow noted within the saphenous vein graft.

Hemodynamic monitoring was begun.  Time-out was called and the patient eye operated upon and lens implant intended were verbally verified.  Three drops of tetracaine were applied to the operative eye.  The patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for intraocular surgery.  A lid speculum was placed.  Two paracentesis sites were created approximately 120 degrees apart straddling the temple using a slit knife.  The anterior chamber was irrigated with a dilute 0.25% solution of non-preserved lidocaine and filled with Viscoat.  The clear corneal temporal incision was fashioned.  The anterior chamber was entered by introducing a keratome.  The continuous tear capsulorrhexis was performed using the bent needle cystotome and completed with Utrata forceps.  The cataractous lens was then hydrodissected and phacoemulsified using a modified phaco-chop technique.  Following removal of the last nuclear quadrant, there was noted to be a posterior capsular hole nasally.  This area was tamponaded with Healon.  The anterior chamber was swept with a cyclodialysis spatula and there was noted to be vitreous prolapse.  An anterior vitrectomy was then performed bimanually until the vitreous was cleared from the anterior chamber area.

A compressed median nerve at the carpal tunnel, which was flattened.,2.  A stenosing tenosynovitis of the A1 pulley of the right index as well as middle fingers.  After the A1 pulley was released, there was evidence of some synovitis as well as some fraying of the flexor digitorum profundus as well as flexor digitorum superficialis tendons.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 78-year-old male who is complaining of right hand pain and numbness with decreased range of the middle index finger and right middle finger complaining of catching and locking.  The patient was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome on bilateral hands the right being worse than the left.  He had positive EMG findings as well as clinical findings.  The patient did undergo an injection, which only provided him with temporary relief and is for this reason, he has consented to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was wheeled back to the operating room #1 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/29/03.  He was placed supine on the operating room table.  Next, a non-sterile tourniquet was placed on the right forearm, but not inflated.  At this time, 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was instilled into the carpal tunnel region of the volar aspect of the wrist for anesthesia.  In addition, an additional 2 cc were used on the superficial skin of the volar palm over the A1 pulley of the right index and right middle fingers.  At this time, the extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  First, we went for release of the carpal tunnel.  Approximately 2.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the wrist over the carpal tunnel region.  First, dissection through the skin in the superficial fascia was performed with a self-retractor placed in addition to Ragnells retracting proximally and distally.  The palmaris brevis muscle was then identified and sharply transected.  At this time, we identified the transverse carpal tunnel ligament and a #15 blade was used to sharply and carefully release that fascia.  Once the fascia of the transverse carpal ligament was transected, the identification of the median nerve was visualized.  The resection of the ligament was taken both proximally and distally to assure complete release and it was checked thoroughly.  At this time, a neurolysis was performed and no evidence of space-occupying lesions were identified within the carpal tunnel.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  The wound was suctioned dry.  At this time, we proceeded to the release of the A1 pulleys.  Approximately, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the A1 pulley in the volar aspect of the palm of the right index and right middle fingers.  First, we went for the index finger.  Once the skin incision was made, Metzenbaum scissor was used to longitudinally dissect the subcutaneous tissue and with Ragnell retractors we identified the A1 pulley.  A #15 blade was used to make a longitudinal slit along with A1 pulley and the Littler scissors were used to release the A1 pulley proximally as well as distally.  Once this was performed, a tendon hook was then used to wrap the tendon and release the tendons both proximally and distally and they were removed from the wound in order to check their integrity.  There was some evidence of synovitis in addition to some fraying of the both the profundus as well as superficialis tendons.  Once a thorough release was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate that wound.  In the similar fashion, a 1.5 cm incision was made over the volar aspect of the A1 pulley of the right middle finger.  A Littler scissor was used to bluntly dissect in the longitudinal fashion.  With the Ragnell retractors, we identified the A1 pulley of the right middle finger.,Using a #15 blade, the A1 pulley was scored with the #15 blade and the Litter scissor was used to complete the release of the A1 pulley distally and proximally.  We again placed the tendon hook around both the superficialis and the profundus tendons and they were extruded from the wound to check their integrity.  Again, there was evidence of some synovitis as well as fraying of both tendons.  The girth of both tendons and both wounds were within normal limits.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound.  The patient was then asked to intraoperatively flex and extend his fingers and he was able to fully flex his fingers to make a close fit which he was not able to do preoperatively.  In addition, he was able to abduct his thumb indicating that the recurrent branch of the median nerve was intact.  At this time, #5-0 nylon was used to approximate in a vertical mattress type fashion both the carpal tunnel incision as well as the both A1 pulley incisions of the right middle finger and right index finger.  The wound closure took place after the tourniquet was released and hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery.  At this time, a short-arm splint was placed on the volar aspect of the wrist after it was wrapped in a sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic and Kerlix roll.  The patient was then carefully taken off of the operating room table to Recovery in stable condition.","surgery, compressed median nerve, stenosing tenosynovitis, carpal tunnel release, carpal tunnel syndrome, middle fingers, carpal tunnel, littler scissors, median nerve, copious irrigation, volar aspect, tunnel, pulley, carpal, fingers, index, tourniquet, ligament, tenosynovitis, superficialis, tendons,"

This loose body was then subsequently removed.  It measured 24 x 14 mm.  This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: , The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain.  He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee.  The patient presented here for a second opinion.  Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  The standard portals were marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade.  Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line.  There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch.  This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal.  Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis.  The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle.  The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology.  ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch.,Attention was then turned back to the large defect.  The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver.  Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances.  Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites.  All instruments were then removed.  The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl.  A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee.  Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias.  The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes.  He was taken to recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family.  The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos.  There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle.  His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant.  All questions were answered.  The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days.","surgery, knee arthroscopy, chondroplasty, medial femoral condyle, cartilage loose body, loose cartilage, knee, arthroscopy, tourniquet, microfracture, orthopedic, femoral, cartilage, "

The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia.  He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position.  Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.

Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280).,ANESTHESIA: , General anesthesia with intubation.,INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: , This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic.  He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis.  Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation.  He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity.  However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger.  These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts.  Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger.  Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger.  Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary.  Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of ""ping-pong ball sign"" due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers.  However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time.,The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks.  Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve.  This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef.  The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion.  A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm.  The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.  I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease.  Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal.  I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm.  Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel.  The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so.  There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression.  The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified.  The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures.,I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle.  Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass.  In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap.  I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve.,I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm.  The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised.  The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures.  Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips.  I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers.  The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques.  In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner.,I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner.  Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other.  So that in effect a lengthening is performed.  Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures.  I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve.  The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis.  Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound.  A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist.  Fingers and femoral were free to move.  The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage.  Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition.

A high-grade narrowing was present at the proximal internal carotid and this tapered well to a slightly small diameter internal carotid.  This was repaired with a Dacron patch and the patient tolerated this well under regional anesthetic without need for shunting.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  Longitudinal incisions were made along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, carried down through subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The platysmal muscle was divided.  The carotid sheath was identified and opened.  The vagus nerve, ansa cervicalis, and hypoglossal nerves were identified and avoided.  The common internal and external carotids were then freed from the surrounding tissue.  At this point, 10,000 units of aqueous heparin were administered and allowed to take effect.  The external and common carotids were then clamped.  The patient's neurological status was evaluated and found to be unchanged from preoperative levels.,Once sufficient time had lapsed, we proceeded with the procedure.  The carotid bulb was opened with a #11 blade and extended with Potts scissors through the very tight lesion into normal internal carotid.  The plaque was then sharply excised proximally and an eversion endarterectomy was performed successfully at the external.  The plaque tapered nicely on the internal and no tacking sutures were necessary.  Heparinized saline was injected and no evidence of flapping or other debris was noted.  The remaining carotid was examined under magnification, which showed no debris of flaps present.  At this point, a Dacron patch was brought on to the field, cut to appropriate length and size, and anastomosed to the artery using #6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Prior to the time of last stitch, the internal carotid was back-bled through this.  The last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The internal was again gently occluded while flow was restored to the common and external carotids for several moments and then flow was restored to the entire system.  At this point, a total of 50 mg of Protamine was administered and allowed to take effect.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and closed in layers using #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponge, needles, and instrument count were correct.

She does have known critical carotid artery stenosis.  She wishes to undergo bilateral carotid endarterectomy, however, it was felt necessary by Dr. X to perform cardiac catheterization.  She was admitted to the hospital yesterday with chest pain.  She has been considered for coronary artery bypass grafting.  I have been asked to address the carotid stenosis, left being more severe, this was addressed first.  Intraoperatively, an atherosclerotic plaque was noted in the common carotid artery extending into the internal carotid artery.  The internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  The external carotid artery was occluded at its origin.  When the endarterectomy was performed, the external carotid artery back-bled nicely.  The internal carotid artery had good backflow bleeding noted.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the OR suite and placed in the supine position.  Then neck, shoulder, and chest wall were prepped and draped in appropriate manner.  Longitudinal incision was created along the anterior border of the left sternocleidal mastoid muscle and this was taken through the subcutaneous tissue and platysmal muscle utilizing electrocautery.,Utilizing both blunt and sharp dissections, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery beyond the atherosclerotic back, the external carotid artery, and the superior thyroid artery were isolated and encircled with a umbilical tape.  During the dissection, facial veins were ligated with #4-0 silk ligature prior to dividing them.  Also during the dissection, ansa cervicalis, hypoglossal, and vagus nerve identified and preserved.  There was some inflammation above the carotid bulb, but this was not problematic.,The patient had been administered 5000 units of aqueous heparin after allowing adequate circulating time.  The internal carotid artery is controlled with Heifitz clip followed by the external carotid artery and the superior thyroid artery being controlled with Heifitz clips.  The common carotid artery was controlled with profunda clamp.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  A longitudinal arteriotomy was created along the posterior lateral border of the common carotid artery.  This was extended across the lobe on to the internal carotid artery.  An endarterectomy was then performed.  The ________ intima was cleared of all debris and the ________ was flushed with copious amounts of heparinized saline.  As mentioned before, the internal carotid artery is quite torturous.  This was shortened by imbricating the internal carotid artery with horizontal mattress stitches of #7-0 Prolene suture.,The wound was copiously irrigated, rather an endovascular patch was then brought on to the field.  This was cut to shape and length.  This was sutured in place with continuous running #6-0 Prolene suture.  The suture line began at both sites.  The suture was tied in the center along the anterior and posterior walls.  Prior to completing the closure, the common carotid artery was flushed.  The internal carotid artery permitted to back bleed.  The clamp was placed after completing the closure.  The clamp was placed at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  Flow was first directed into the external carotid artery then into the internal carotid artery.  The patient remained neurologically intact.  Topical ________ Gelfoam was utilized.  Of note, during the endarterectomy, the patient did receive an additional 7000 units of aqueous heparin.  The wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  Sponge, needle, and all counts were correct.  All surgical sites were inspected.  Good hemostasis noted.  The incision was closed in layers with absorbable suture.  Stainless steel staples approximated skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.

He, since 10:17 p.m. on 01/17/10, noted recurrence of his atrial fibrillation, called our office this morning, that is despite being on flecainide, atenolol, and he is maintained on Coumadin.,The patient has noted some lightheadedness as well as chest discomfort and shortness of breath when atrial flutter recurred and we see that on his 12-lead EKG here.  Otherwise, no chest pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Significant for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and again he had atrial fibrillation more persistently in 2006, but more recently it has been atrial flutter and that is despite use of antiarrhythmics including flecainide.  He completed a stress test in my office within the past several weeks that was normal without evidence of ischemia.  Other medical history is significant for hyperlipidemia.,MEDICATIONS:,As outpatient,,1.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.,2.  Altace 2.5 mg once a day.,3.  Zocor 20 mg once a day.,4.  Flecainide 200 in the morning and 100 in the evening.,5.  Coumadin as directed by our office.,ALLERGIES: , TO MEDICATIONS ARE NONE.  HE DENIES SHRIMP, SEA FOOD OR DYE ALLERGY.,FAMILY HISTORY: , He has a nephew who was his sister's son who passed away at age 22 reportedly from an MI, but was reported to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as well.  The patient has previously met with the electrophysiologist, Dr. X, at General Hospital and it sounds like he had a negative EP study.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient does not smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol nor drink any caffeine.  No use of illicit drugs.  He has been married for 22 years and he is actually accompanied throughout today's cardiology consultation by his wife.  He is not participating in regular exercises now because he states since starting flecainide, he has gotten sluggish.  He is employed as an attorney and while he states that overall his mental stress is better, he has noted more recent mental stress this past weekend when he was taking his daughter back to college.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He denies any history of stroke, cancer, vomiting of blood, coughing up blood, bright red blood per rectum, bleeding stomach ulcers, renal calculi.  There are some questions especially as his wife has told me that he may have obstructive sleep apnea and not had a formal sleep study.,PHYSICAL EXAM: , Blood pressure 156/93, pulse is 100, respiratory rate 18.

Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using ""lollipop posterior patch"" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient's general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient's bedside regarding our findings.",

Left heart catheterization.,4.  Left ventriculogram.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:,  A 50-year-old lady with known history of coronary artery disease with previous stenting to the left anterior descending artery presents with symptoms of shortness of breath.  The resting echocardiogram showed a severe decrease in her left ventricular systolic function with a reported LVEF of 20% to 25%.  This was a sharp decline from a previous LVEF of 50% to 55%.  We therefore, decided to proceed with coronary angiography.,TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in post-absorptive and non-sedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  2% Lidocaine was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery.  6-French JL4 and JR4 diagnostic catheters were used to perform the left and right coronary angiogram.  A 6-French pigtail catheter was used to perform the LV-gram in the RAO projection.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA: , LVEDP of 11.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,1.  The left main coronary artery is a very short vessel and immediately bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex coronary artery.,2.  The left main coronary artery is free of any disease.,3.  The left circumflex coronary artery which is a nondominant vessel gives off 2 marginal branches.  The first marginal branch is very small in caliber and runs a fairly long course and is free of any disease.,4.  The second marginal branch which is actually a continuation of the left circumflex coronary artery gives off several secondary branches.  One of its secondary branches which is a small caliber has an ostial 70% stenosis.,5.  The left anterior descending artery has a patent stent in the proximal LAD.  The second stent which is overlapping the junction of the mid and distal left anterior descending artery has mild late luminal loss.  There appears to be 30% narrowing involving the distal cuff segment of the stent in the distal left anterior descending artery.  The diagonal branches are free of any disease.,6.  The right coronary artery is a dominant vessel and has mild luminal irregularities.  Its midsegment has a focal area of 30% narrowing as well.  The rest of the right coronary artery is free of any disease.,7.  The LV-gram performed in the RAO projection shows well preserved left ventricular systolic function with an estimated LVEF of 55%.,RECOMMENDATION: , Continue with optimum medical therapy.  Because of the discrepancy between the left ventriculogram EF assessment and the echocardiographic EF assessment, I have discussed this matter with Dr. XYZ and we have decided to proceed with a repeat 2D echocardiogram.  The mild disease in the distal left anterior descending artery with mild in-stent re-stenosis should be managed medically with optimum control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.","surgery, heart catheterization, ventriculogram, femoral artery access, coronary angiogram, lvef, distal left anterior descending, circumflex coronary artery, anterior descending artery, femoral artery, systolic function, cardiac catheterization, circumflex coronary, anterior descending, coronary artery, coronary, artery, catheterization, descending"

The patient was then given sedation.  Once this was complete, the area overlying the carpal ligament was carefully injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  The patient had this area carefully and thoroughly injected with approximately 10 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine and once this was complete, a 15-blade knife was then used to incise the skin opposite the radial aspect of the fourth ray.  Careful dissection under direct visualization was performed through the subcutaneous fat as well as through the palmar fascia.  A Weitlaner retractor was then used to retract the skin and careful dissection through the palmar fascia would then revealed the transverse carpal ligament.  This was then carefully incised using a 15-blade knife and once entry was again into the carpal canal, a Freer elevator was then inserted and under direct visualization, the carpal ligament was then released.  The transverse carpal ligament was carefully released first in the distal direction until palmar fat could be visualized and by palpation no further ligament could be felt.  The area was well hemostased with the 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and both proximal and distal dissection along the nerve was performed.  Visualization of the transverse carpal ligament was maintained with Weitlaner retractor as well as centric.  Both the centric and the Ragnell were used to retract both proximal and distal corners of the incision and the entirety of the area was under direct visualization at all times.  Palmar fascia was released both proximally and distally as well as the transverse carpal ligament.  Direct palpation of the carpal canal demonstrated a full and complete release.  Observation of the median nerve revealed an area of hyperemia in the distal two-thirds of the nerve, which demonstrated the likely area of compression.  Once this was complete, hemostasis was established using bipolar cautery and some small surface bleeders and irrigation of the area was performed and then the closure was achieved with 4-0 chromic suture in a horizontal mattress and interrupted stitch.  Xeroform was then applied to the incision.  A bulky dressing was then applied consisting of Kerlix and Ace wrap, and the patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition without any complications.","surgery, carpal tunnel syndrome, ace wrap, emg, freer elevator, kerlix, weitlaner retractor, bulky dressing, carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel release, palmar fascia, subcutaneous fat, lidocaine with epinephrine, transverse carpal ligament, carpal ligament, carpal, tunnel, ligament,"
1095, Cardioversion.  An 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , Surgery, Cardioversion ,"HISTORY: , The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement in the past with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted yesterday with the recurrence of such in a setting of hypokalemia, incomplete compliance with obstructive sleep apnea therapy with CPAP, chocolate/caffeine ingestion and significant mental stress.  Despite repletion of her electrolytes and maintenance with Diltiazem IV she has maintained atrial fibrillation.  I have discussed in detail with the patient regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure.  After an in depth discussion of the procedure (please see my initial consultation for further details) I asked the patient this morning if she would like me to repeat that as that discussion had happened yesterday.  The patient declined.  I invited questions for her which she stated she had none and wanted to go forward with the cardioversion which seemed appropriate.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol including proper identification of the patient, physician, procedure, documentation, and there were no safety issues identified by myself nor the staff.  The patient participated actively in this.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed then and 50 micrograms of fentanyl with utilizing titrated conscious sedation with good effect.  She was placed in the supine position and hands free patches had previously been placed in the AP position and she received one synchronized cardioversion attempt after Diltiazem drip had been turned off with successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm.  This was confirmed on 12 lead EKG.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from recurrent atrial fibrillation.  The patient's electrolytes are now normal and that will need close watching to avoid hypokalemia in the future, as well as she has been previously counseled for strict adherence to sleep apnea therapy with CPAP and perhaps repeat sleep evaluation would be appropriate to titrate her settings, as well as avoidance of caffeine ingestion including chocolate and minimization of mental stress.  She will be discharged on her usual robust AV nodal antiarrhythmic therapy with sotalol 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Diltiazem CD 240 mg p.o. daily and digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. daily and to be clear she does have a permanent pacemaker implanted.  She will follow-up with her regular cardiologist, Dr. X, for whom I am covering this weekend.,This was all discussed in detail with the patient, as well as her granddaughter with the patient's verbal consent at the bedside.","surgery, atrial fibrillation, aortic valve, paroxysmal, normal sinus rhythm, sinus rhythm, cpap, cardioversion, fibrillation, atrial,"

The right femoral artery was entered with _______ modified Seldinger technique and a J wire was passed.  The needle was exchanged for 6 French sheath.  The wire was removed.  The sheath was washed with sterile saline.  Following this, the left coronary was attempted to be cannulated with an XP catheter, however, the catheter folded on itself and could not reach the left main, this was removed.  A second 6-French JL4 guiding catheter was then used to cannulate the left main and initial guiding shots demonstrated occlusion of the proximal LAD.  The patient had an ACT check, received additional IV heparin and IV ReoPro.  The lesion was crossed with 0.014 BMW wire and redilated with a 2.5 x 20-mm balloon at nominal pressures.

PROCEDURES:, XXXXXX was brought to the catheterization lab and was anesthetized by anesthesia. He was intubated. His supplemental oxygen was weaned to 24%, on which all of his hemodynamics were obtained. The patient was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion, including both groins and the right neck. Xylocaine was administered in the right femoral area. A 6-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral vein percutaneously without complication. A 4-French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery percutaneously without complication. A 4-French pigtail catheter was introduced and passed to the abdominal aorta.,Dr. Hayes, using the SiteRite device, introduced a 5-French sheath into the right internal jugular vein without complication.,A 5-French wedge catheter was introduced through the sheath in the right internal jugular vein and was passed to the left pulmonary artery and further to the left pulmonary capillary wedge position. This catheter would not pass to the right pulmonary artery. The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French IMA catheter was then introduced and passed to the right pulmonary artery. After right pulmonary artery pressure was measured, this catheter was removed.,The 5 wedge catheter was advanced through the right femoral sheath and was passed to the following chambers or vessels: Inferior vena cava, right atrium, left atrium, and right ventricle.,The previously introduced 4 pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta. Simultaneous right ventricular and ascending aortic pressures were measured. A pullback from ascending aorta to descending aorta was then performed. Simultaneous measurements of right ventricular and descending aortic pressures were measured.,The wedge catheter was removed. A 5-French Berman catheter was advanced down the Glenn shunt to the right pulmonary artery, where a pullback from right pulmonary artery to Glenn shunt was performed. An injection was then performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 8 mL per second with the Berman catheter positioned in the Glenn shunt. The 5-French Berman was removed.,A 6-French Berman was introduced through the right femoral vein sheath and was advanced to the right ventricle. A right ventriculogram was performed using Omnipaque 18 mL at 12 mL per second. The Berman catheter was pulled back to the inferior vena cava, where an inferior vena cavagram was performed using Omnipaque 10 mL at 8 mL per second.,The 4-French pigtail catheter was advanced to the ascending aorta and an ascending aortogram was performed using Omnipaque 16 mL at 12 mL per second.,Following the ascending angiograms, two kidneys and a bladder were noted. The catheters and sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was obtained by direct pressure. The estimated blood loss was less than 30 mL, and none was replaced. Heparin was administered following placement of all of the sheaths. Pulse oximetry saturation, pulse in the right foot, and EKG were monitored continuously.,II. PRESSURES:,A. Left pulmonary artery, mean of 11; left capillary wedge, mean of 9; main pulmonary artery, mean of 12; right pulmonary artery, mean of 10; descending aorta, 75/45, mean of 57; right atrium, A6 to 9, V6 to 8, mean 7; left atrium, mean 8; inferior vena cava, mean 7.,B. Ascending aorta, 65/35, with a simultaneous right ventricular pressure of 70/10; descending aorta, 60/35, with a right ventricular pressure of 72/10.,C. Pullbacks, left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery, mean of 11 to mean of 12; main pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; right pulmonary artery to Glenn, mean of 12 to mean of 13; ascending aorta 68/35 to descending aorta 62/35.,INTERPRETATION:, Right and left pulmonary artery pressures are appropriate for this situation. There is a gradient of, at most, 2 mmHg on pullback from both the right and left pulmonary arteries to the Glenn shunt. The left atrial mean pressure is normal. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is, at most, slightly elevated. There is a trivial gradient between the right ventricle and ascending aorta consistent with trivial neo-aortic valve stenosis. There is a roughly 10-mm gradient between the right ventricle and descending aorta, consistent with additional coarctation of the aorta. On pullback from ascending to descending aorta, there is a 6-mmHg gradient between the two. Systemic blood pressure is normal.,III. OXIMETRY:, Superior vena cava 65, right pulmonary artery 67, left pulmonary artery 65, left atrium 96, right atrium 87, inferior vena cava 69, aorta 86, right ventricle 83.,INTERPRETATION:, Systemic arteriovenous oxygenation difference is normal, consistent with a normal cardiac output. Left atrial saturation is fairly normal, consistent with normal oxygenation in the lungs. The saturation falls passing from the left atrium to the right atrium and further to the right ventricle, consistent with mixing of pulmonary venous return and inferior vena cava return, as would be expected in this patient.,IV. SPECIAL PROCEDURE (S):, None done.,V. CALCULATIONS:,Please see the calculation sheet. Calculations were based upon an assumed oxygen consumption. The _____ saturation used was 67%, with a pulmonary artery saturation of 65%, a left atrial saturation of 96%, and an aortic saturation of 86%. Using the above information, the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio was 0.6. Systemic blood flow was 5.1 liters per minute per meter squared. Pulmonary blood flow was 3.2 liters per minute per meter squared. Systemic resistance was 9.8 Wood's units times meter squared, which is mildly diminished. Pulmonary resistance was 2.5 Wood's units times meter squared, which is in the normal range.,VI. ANGIOGRAPHY:, The injection to the Glenn shunt demonstrates a wide-open Glenn connection. The right pulmonary artery is widely patent, without stenosis. The proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery is significantly narrowed, but does open up near its branch point. The right pulmonary artery measures 6.5, the left pulmonary artery measures 3.0 mm. The aorta at the diaphragm on a later injection was 5.5 mm. There is a small collateral off the innominate vein passing to the left upper lobe. Flow to both upper lobes is diminished versus lower lung fields. There is normal return of the pulmonary veins from the right, with simultaneous filling of the left atrium and right atrium. There is normal return of the left lower pulmonary vein and left upper pulmonary vein. There is some reflux of dye into the inferior vena cava from the right atrium.,The right ventriculogram demonstrates a heavily pedunculated right ventricle with somewhat depressed right ventricular systolic function. The calculated ejection fraction from the LAO projection is only mildly diminished at 59%. There is no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The neo-aortic valve appears to open well with no stenosis. The ascending aorta is dilated. There is mild narrowing of the aorta at the isthmal area. On some projections, there appears to be a partial duplication of the aortic arch, probably secondary to this patient's style of Norwood reconstruction. There is some filling of the right upper and left upper lobes from collateral blood flow, with the left being more opacified than the right.,The inferior vena cavagram demonstrates normal return of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.,The ascending aortogram demonstrates trivial aortic insufficiency, which is probably catheter-induced. The coronary arteries are poorly seen. Again, a portion of the aorta appears to be partially duplicated. There is faint opacification of the left upper lung from collateral blood flow. The above-mentioned narrowing of the aortic arch is again noted.",

CPK is already over 1000. There is ST elevation in leads II and aVF, as well as a Q wave. The chest pain is now gone, mild residual shortness of breath, no orthopnea. Cardiac monitor shows resolution of ST elevation lead III.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, Following sterile prep and drape of the right groin, installation of 1% Xylocaine anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was percutaneously entered and 6-French sheath inserted. ACT approximately 165 seconds on heparin. Borderline hypotension 250 mL fluid bolus given and nitroglycerin patch removed. Selective left and right coronary injections performed using Judkins coronary catheters with a 6-French pigtail catheter used to obtain left ventricular pressures and left ventriculography. Left pullback pressure. Sheath injection. Hemostasis obtained with a 6-French Angio-Seal device. He tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Cardiac Step-Down Unit in stable condition.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Left ventricular end diastolic pressure elevated post A-wave at 25 mm of Mercury with no aortic valve systolic gradient on pullback.,ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:,I. Left coronary artery: The left main coronary artery is unremarkable. The left anterior descending has 30 to 40% narrowing with tortuosity in its proximal portion, patent first septal perforator branch. The first diagonal branch is a 2 mm vessel with a 90% ostial stenosis. The second diagonal branch is unremarkable, as are the tiny distal diagonal branches. The intermediate branch is a small, normal vessel. The ostial non-dominant circumflex has some contrast thinning, but no stenosis, normal obtuse marginal branch, and small AV sulcus circumflex branch.,II. Right coronary artery: The right coronary artery is a large, dominant vessel which gives off large posterior descending and posterolateral left ventricular branches. There are luminal irregularities, less than 25%, within the proximal to mid vessel. Some contrast thinning is present in the distal RCA just before the bifurcation into posterior descending and posterolateral branches. A 25%, smooth narrowing at the origin of the posterior descending branch. Posterolateral branch is unremarkable and quite large, with secondary and tertiary branches.,III. Left ventriculogram: The left ventricle is normal in size. Ejection fraction estimated at 40 to 45%. No mitral regurgitation.

Closure device the seal the femoral arteriotomy using an Angio-Seal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: ,The patient with known coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and multiple risk factors of coronary disease, who had her last coronary arteriogram performed in 2004. She has had complaints of progressive chest discomfort, and has ongoing risks including current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia to name a few. The decision was made to proceed on with percutaneous evaluation and possible intervention given her known disease and the possibility of disease progression.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization lab where her procedure was performed. She was prepped and prepared on the table; after which, her right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery over a standard 0.035 guide wire. Coronary angiography and left ventricular measurement and angiography were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery. A 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right groin and her artery and the saphenous vein graft conduit. Subsequently, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter was used to measure left ventricular pressures and to perform a power injection, a left ventriculogram at 8 mL per second for a total of 30 mL. At the conclusion of the diagnostic evaluation, the patient had selective arteriography of her right femoral artery, which showed the right femoral artery to be free of significant atherosclerotic plaque. Did have a normal bifurcation into the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries and to have an arteriotomy that was in the common femoral artery away from the bifurcation. As such, an initial attempt to advance a Perclose device failed to allow the device descend to _____ tract and into the appropriate position within the artery. As such, the Perclose was never deployed and was removed intact over the wire from the system. We then replaced this with a 6-French Angio-Seal which was used to seal the femoral arteriotomy with achievement of hemostasis. The patient was subsequently dispositioned back to the MAC Unit where she will complete her bedrest prior to her disposition to home.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, Opening aortic pressure 125/60, left ventricular pressure 108/4 with an end-diastolic pressure of 16. There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve on pullback from the left ventricle. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%. Mitral regurgitation was less than or equal to 1+. There was normal wall motion in the RAO projection.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery had mild atherosclerotic plaque. The proximal LAD was 100% occluded. The left circumflex had mild diffuse atherosclerotic plaque. The obtuse marginal branch which operates as an OM-2 had a mid approximately 80% stenosis at a kink in the artery. This appears to be the area of a prior anastomosis, the saphenous vein graft to the OM. This is a very small-caliber vessel and is 1.5-mm in diameter at best. The right coronary artery is dominant. The native right coronary artery had mild proximal and mid atherosclerotic plaque. The distal right coronary artery has an approximate 40% stenosis. The posterior left ventricular branch has a proximal 50 to 60% stenosis. The proximal PDA has a 40 to 50% stenosis. The saphenous vein graft to the right PDA is widely patent. There was competitive flow noted between the native right coronary artery and the saphenous vein graft to the PDA. The runoff from the PDA is nice with the native proximal PDA and PLV disease as noted above. There is also some retrograde filling of the right coronary artery from the runoff of this graft. The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending is widely patent. The LAD beyond the distal anastomosis is a relatively small-caliber vessel. There is some retrograde filling that allows some filling into a more proximal diagonal branch. The saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal was known to be occluded from the prior study in 2004. Overall, this study does not look markedly different than the procedure performed in 2004.,CONCLUSION:, 100% proximal LAD mild left circumflex disease with an OM that is a small-caliber vessel with an 80% lesion at a kink that is no amenable to percutaneous intervention. The native right coronary artery has mild to moderate distal disease with moderate PLV and PDA disease. The saphenous vein graft to the OM is known to be 100% occluded. The saphenous vein graft to the PDA and the saphenous vein graft to the LAD are open. Normal left ventricular systolic function.,PLAN:, The plan will be for continued medical therapy and risk factor modification. Aggressive antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive control. The patient's goal LDL will be at or below 70 with triglyceride level at or below 150, and it is very imperative that the patient stop smoking.,After her bedrest is complete, she will be dispositioned to home, after which, she will be following up with me in the office within 1 month.

1101, Cardiac catheterization.   Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis., Surgery, Cardiac Catheterization - 12 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Coronary artery disease plus intimal calcification in the mid abdominal aorta without significant stenosis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,LEFT HEART CATHETERIZATION WITH ANGIOGRAPHY AND MID ABDOMINAL AORTOGRAPHY:,Under local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with premedication, a right groin preparation was done.  Using the percutaneous Seldinger technique via the right femoral artery, a left heart catheterization was performed.  Coronary arteriography was performed with 6-French performed coronary catheters.  We used a 6-French JR4 and JL4 catheters to take multiple cineangiograms of the right and left coronary arteries.  After using the JR4 6-French catheter, nitroglycerin was administered because of the possibility of ostial spasm, and following that, we used a 5-French JR4 catheter for additional cineangiograms of the right coronary artery.  A pigtail catheter was placed in the mid abdominal aorta and abdominal aortic injection was performed to rule out abdominal aortic aneurysm, as there was dense calcification in the mid abdominal aorta.,ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE DATA: , Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 5 mmHg.  On continuous tracing from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta, there is no gradient across the aortic valve.  The aortic pressures were normal.  Contours of intracardiac pressure were normal.,ANALYSIS OF ANGIOGRAMS:,  Selective cineangiograms were obtained with injection of contrast to the left ventricle, coronary arteries, and mid abdominal aorta.  A pigtail catheter was introduced into the left ventricle and ventriculogram performed in right anterior oblique position.  The mitral valve is competent and demonstrates normal mobility.  The left ventricular cavity is normal in size with excellent contractility.  Aneurysmal dilatation and/or dyskinesia absent.  The aortic valve is tricuspid and normal mobility.  The ascending aorta appeared normal.,Pigtail catheter was introduced in the mid abdominal aorta and placed just above the renal arteries.  An abdominal aortic injection was performed.  Under fluoroscopy, we see heavy dense calcification of the mid abdominal aorta between the renal artery and the bifurcation.  There was some difficulty initially with maneuvering the wire pass that area and it was felt that might be a tight stenosis.  The abdominal aortogram reveals wide patency of that area with mild intimal irregularity.  There is a normal left renal artery, normal right renal artery.  The celiac seems to be normal, but what I believe is the splenic artery seen initially at its origin is normal.  The common left iliac and common right iliac arteries are essentially normal in this area.,CORONARY ANATOMY:,  One notes ostial coronary calcification of the right coronary artery.  Cineangiogram obtained with 6-French JR4 and 5-French JR4 catheters.  Prior to the introduction of the 5-French JR4 nitroglycerin was administered sublingually.  The 6-French JR4 catheters appeared to a show an ostial lesion of over 50%.  There was backwash of dye into the aorta, although there is a fine funneling of the ostium towards the proximal right coronary artery.  In the proximal portion of the right coronary artery just into the Shepherd turn, there is a 50% smooth tapering of the right coronary artery in the proximal third.  Then the artery seems to have a little bit more normal size and it divides into a large posterior descending artery posterolateral branch vessel.  The distal portion of the vessel is free of disease.  The conus branch is seen arising right at the beginning part of the right coronary artery.  We then removed the 6-French catheter and following nitroglycerin and sublingually we placed a 5-French catheter and again finding a stenosis, may be less than 50%.  At the ostium of the right coronary artery, calcification again is identified.  Backwash of dye noted at the proximal lesion, looked about the same 50% along the proximal turn of the Shepherd turn area.,The left coronary artery is normal, although there is a rim of ostial calcification, but there is no tapering or stenosis.  It forms the left anterior descending artery, the ramus branch, and the circumflex artery.,The left anterior descending artery is a very large vessel, very tortuous in its proximal segment, very tortuous in its mid and distal segment.  There appears to be some mild stenosis of 10% in the proximal segment.  It gives off a large diagonal branch in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery and it is free of disease.  The remaining portion of the left anterior descending artery is free of disease.  Upon injection of the left coronary artery, we see what I believe is the dye enters probably directly into the left ventricle, but via fistula excluding the coronary sinus, and we get a ventriculogram performed.  I could not identify an isolated area, but it seems to be from the interventricular septal collaterals that this is taking place.,The ramus branch is normal and free of disease.,The left circumflex artery is a tortuous vessel over the lateral wall and terminating in the inferoposterior wall that is free of disease.,The patient has a predominantly right coronary system.

Ostial stenosis of the right coronary artery that appears to be about 50% or greater.  The proximal right coronary artery has 50% stenosis as well.,5.  Coronary calcification is seen under fluoroscopy at the ostia of the left and right coronary arteries.,RECOMMENDATIONS:  ,The patient has heavy calcification of the coronary arteries and continued risk factor management is needed.  The ostial lesion of the right coronary artery may be severe.  It is at least 50%, but it could be worse.  Therefore, she will be evaluated for the possibility of an IVUS and/or _______ analysis of the proximal right coronary artery.  We will reevaluate her stress nuclear study as well.

1103," Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.", Surgery, Cardiac Catheterization ,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization.","surgery, heart catheterization, cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, thermodilution technique, transducer, diffuse luminal irregularities, cardiac catheterization, luminal irregularities, aortic valve, coronary artery, artery, catheterization, regurgitation, angiography, thermodilution, coronary,"

Right posterior descending artery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty followed by stenting.,4. Right femoral artery angiography.,5. Perclose to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:, Patient presenting with a history of coronary artery disease in the past with coronary angiography in the early 1990s. The patient presented with what appeared to be a COPD exacerbation and had mildly positive cardiac enzyme markers suggestive of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was subsequently dispositioned to the cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where his procedure was performed. The patient was appropriately prepped and prepared on the table, after which his right groin was locally anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. Then, a 6-French sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery. Over a standard 0.035 guidewire, coronary angiography and left ventricular pressure measurements were performed using a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter to image the left coronary artery, a 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter to image the right coronary artery, a 6-French angled pigtail catheter to measure left ventricular pressure. At the conclusion of the diagnostic study, the case was progressed to percutaneous coronary intervention, which will be described below. Subsequently, right femoral artery angiography was performed which showed right femoral artery which was free of significant atherosclerotic plaque, and an arteriotomy that was suitable for a closure device. Then, a Perclose was used to seal the right femoral arteriotomy.,HEMODYNAMIC DATA:, The opening aortic pressure was 91/63. The left ventricular pressure was 94/13 with an end-diastolic pressure of 24. Left ventricular ejection fraction was not assessed, as ventriculogram was not performed. The patient did have some elevated creatinine earlier in this hospital course which warranted limitation of contrast where possible.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAM:, The left main coronary artery was angiographically okay. The LAD had mild diffuse disease. There appeared to be distal tapering of the LAD. The left circumflex had mild diffuse disease. In the very distal aspect of the circumflex after OM-3 and OM-4 type branch, there was a long, severely diseased segment that appeared to be chronic and subtotal in one area. The runoff from this area appeared to be a very small PLOM type branch and continuation of a circ which did not appear to supply much territory, and there was not much to salvage by approaching this lesion. The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease. The PLV branch was 100% occluded at its ostium at the crux. The PDA at the ostium had an 80% stenosis. The PDA was a fairly sizeable vessel with a long course. The right coronary is dominant.,CONCLUSION:, Mild diffuse coronary artery disease with severe distal left circumflex lesion with not much runoff beyond this lesion. This circumflex appears to be chronically diseased and has areas that appear to be subtotal. There is a 100% PLV branch which is also chronic and reported in his angiogram in the 1990s. There is an ostial 80% right PDA lesion. The plan is to proceed with percutaneous intervention to the right PDA.,The case was then progressed to percutaneous intervention of the right PDA. A 6-French JR4 guide catheter with side holes was selected and used to engage the right coronary artery ostium. The lesion was crossed with a long BMW 0.014 guidewire. Then, we ballooned the lesion with a 2.5 x 9 mm Maverick balloon. Subsequently, we stented the lesion with a 2.5 x 16 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent with a nice angiographic result. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, without complications.,ANGIOPLASTY CONCLUSION:, Successful percutaneous intervention with drug-eluting stent placement to the ostium of the PDA.,RECOMMENDATIONS:, Aspirin indefinitely, and Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily for no less than six months. The patient will be dispositioned back to telemetry for further monitoring.,TOTAL MEDICATIONS DURING PROCEDURE:, Versed 1 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg for conscious sedation.

Since that time, the patient has developed significant calcaneal valgus deformity with significant pain.  Radiographs confirmed collapse of the spinal arch, as well as valgus position of the foot.  Given the patient's symptoms, surgery is recommended for calcaneal osteotomy and Achilles lengthening.  Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the mother.  Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia; infection; bleeding; changes in sensation in most of extremity; hardware failure; need for later hardware removal; possible nonunion; possible failure to correct all the deformity; and need for other surgical procedures.  The patient will need to be strict nonweightbearing for at least 6 weeks and wear a brace for up to 6 months.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above surgical plan.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the left thigh.  The extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  The patient had a previous incision along the calcaneocuboid lateral part of the foot.  This was marked and extended proximally through the Achilles tendon.  Extremity was wrapped in Esmarch.  Tourniquet inflation was noted to be 250 mmHg.  Decision was then made to protect the sural nerve.  There was one sensory nervous branch that did cross the field though it was subsequently sharply ligated because it was in the way.  Dissection was carried down to Achilles tendon, which was subsequently de-lengthened with the distal half performed down the lateral thigh.  Proximal end was tacked with an 0 Ethibond suture and subsequently repaired end-on-end at length with the heel in neutral.  Dissection was then carried on the lateral border of the foot with identification of the peroneal longus and valgus tendons, which were removed from the sheath and retracted dorsally.  At this time, we also noted that calcaneocuboid joint appeared to be fused.  The area between the anterior and middle facets were plicated on fluoroscopy for planned osteotomy.  This was performed with a saw.  After a partial plantar fasciotomy was performed, this was released off an abductor digiti minimi.  The osteotomy was completed with an osteotome and distracted with the lamina spreader.  A tricortical allograft was then shaped and subsequently impacted into this area.  Final positioning was checked with multiple views of fluoroscopy.  It was subsequently fixed using a 0.94 K-wire and drilled from the heel anteriorly.  A pin was subsequently bent and cut short at the level of the skin.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline.  The Achilles was repaired with this tie.  Please note during the case, it was noted the patient had continued significant stiffness despite the Achilles lengthening.  A posterior capsulotomy of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints were performed with increased 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Wound was then closed using #2-0 Vicryl and #4-0 Monocryl.  The surgical field was irrigated with 0.25% Marcaine and subsequently injected with more Marcaine at the end of the case.  The wound was clean and dry and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  Skin was dressed with Xeroform and 4 x 4's.  Everything was wrapped with 4 x 4's in sterile Webril.  The tourniquet was released after 69 minutes.  A short-leg cast was then placed with good return of capillary refill to his toes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for elevation, ice packs, neurovascular checks, and pain control.  The patient to be strict nonweightbearing.  We will arrange for her to get a wheelchair.  The patient will then follow up in about 10 to 14 days for a cast check, as well as pain control.  The patient will need an AFO script at that time.

The nipple inframammary fold distance is approximately 1.5 cm shorter than the fuller right breast.  The patient has bilateral Mentor-Smooth round moderate projection jell-filled mammary prosthesis, 225 cc.,The patient was marked in the upright position for mobilization of lateral skin flaps and increase in the length of the nipple inframammary fold distance.  She was then brought to the operating room and after satisfactory LMA anesthesia had been induced, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manger.  The patient received a gram of Kefzol prior to beginning the procedure.  The previous inverted T-scar was excised down to the underlying capsule of the breast implant.  The breast was carefully dissected off of the underlying capsule.  Care being taken to preserve the vascular supply to the skin and breast flap.  When the anterior portion of the breast was dissected free of the underlying capsule, the posterior aspect of the capsule was then dissected off of the underlying pectoralis muscle.  A posterior incision was made on the backside of the capsule at the proximate middle portion of the capsule and then reflected inferiorly thereby creating a superior based capsular flap.  The lateral aspects of the capsule were then opened and the inferior edge of the capsule was then sutured to the underside of the inframammary flap with 2-0 Monocryl statures.  Care was taken to avoid as much exposure of the implant, as well as damage to the implant.  When the flap had been created and advanced, hemostasis was obtained and the area copiously irrigated with a solution of Bacitracin 50,000 units, Kefzol 1 g, gentamicin 80 mg, and 500 cc of saline.  The lateral skin both medially and laterally were then completely freed and the vertical incision of the inverted T was then extended the 2 cm and sutured with a trifurcation suture of 2-0 Biosyn.  This lengthened the vertical portion of the mastopexy scar to allow for descent of the implant and roundness of the inferior pole of the left breast.  The remainder of the inverted T was closed with interrupted sutures of 3 and 2-0 Biosyn and the skin was closed with continuous suture of 5-0 nylon.  Bacitracin and a standard breast dressing were applied.,The anesthesia was terminated and the patient was recovered in the operating room.  Sponge, instrument, needle count reported as corrected.

Insertion of Mahurkar catheter for hemofiltration via the left common femoral vein.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position, he was prepped from shin to knees and draped in a sterile field.  A right common femoral artery vein were then exposed through a longitudinal incision in the right groin and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.  A sternotomy incision was then opened and the lesions from the previous operative procedures were lysed and they were very dense and firm, freeing up the right atrium and the ascending aorta and anterior right ventricle.  The patient was heparinized and then a pursestring suture was placed in the right atrium superior and inferior just above the superior and inferior vena cava.  A percutaneous catheter for arterial return was placed using Seldinger technique through exposed right femoral artery and then two 3-mm catheters were inserted with two pursestring sutures in the right atrium just superior to inferior vena cava.  After satisfactory heparinization has been obtained, the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and another pursestring suture was placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and a catheter was placed for suction in the left atrium.  After the heart was brought to the operating room and triggered, the patient had the ascending aorta clamped and tapes were placed around superior and inferior vena cava and were secured in place.  A cardiectomy was then performed by starting in the right atrium.  The wires from the pacemaker and defibrillator were transected coming from the superior vena cava and the Swan-Ganz catheter was brought out into the operative field.  Cardiectomy was then performed, first resecting the anterior portion of the right atrium and then transecting the aorta, the pulmonary artery, the septum between the right and left atriums, and then the heart was removed.  The right and left atrium, aorta, and pulmonary artery were prepared for the transplant.  First, we did a side-to-side anastomosis, continued to the left atrium and this was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture and a right atrial anastomosis side-to-side was performed using 3-0 Prolene suture.  The pulmonary artery was then anastomosed using 5-0 Prolene and the aorta was anastomosed with 4-0 Prolene.  The arterial anastomosis in the pulmonary artery and aorta were not completed until the heart was filled with blood.  Air was evacuated and the sutures were tied down.  The clamp on the ascending aorta was removed and the patient was gradually overtime weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient had a postoperative coagulopathy which prolonged the period of time in the operating room after completion and weaning off of the cardiopulmonary bypass.  Blood factors and factor VII were given to try and correct the coagulopathy.  Because of excessive transfusions that were required, a Mahurkar catheter was inserted through the left common femoral vein, first placing a needle into the vein and then guidewire removed, and the needle dilators were then placed and then the Mahurkar catheter was then placed with 2-0 nylon suture.  Hemofiltration was started in the operating room at this time.  After he had satisfactory hemostasis, we decided to do the chest open and cover it with Ioban, which we did, and one chest tube was inserted into the mediastinum through a separate stab wound.  The patient also had an intraaortic balloon for counterpulsation which had been inserted into the left subclavian vein preoperatively.  This was left in place and the pulse generation, the pacemaker was in a right infraclavicular position, which was left in place because of the coagulopathy.  The patient received 11 units of packed red blood cells, 7 platelets, 23 fresh-frozen plasma, 20 cryoprecipitates, and factor VII.  Urine output for the procedure was 520 mL.  The preservation time of the heart is in the anesthesia sheet.  The estimated blood loss was at least 6 L.

He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.

Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field.  The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint.  The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe.  In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray.  There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal.  Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection.  The joint capsule was then visualized.  Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule.  A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade.  The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal  phalanx.,A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint.  In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal.  Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head.  A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare.  Next, the bone was passed out as specimen.  The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation.  The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue.  This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed.  The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace.  A lateral release was performed in addition.  Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed.  The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure.  Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint.  A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx.  The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed.,Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position.  It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level.  Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion.  A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature.  There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures.,Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint.  The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded.  The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage.  A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft.  The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position.  An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique.  The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated.  The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation.,Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated.  The same suture material was used.  However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight.  Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well.  A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare.  The toe assumed to more rectus position.  The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces.  The joint was again flushed with saline.  Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique.,Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin.  A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively.  Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly.  A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique.  A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl.  Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated.  Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The tendon was transected.  Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed.  Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position.  One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin.,Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds.  Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds.  Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits.  All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped.  A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c.  She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist.,She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office.

The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinette was reflected.  The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot.  An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule.  Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle.  Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created.  The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal.  Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected.  A lateral capsulotomy was performed.  Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence.  The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone.  Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy.  A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed.  The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle.  After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire.  A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted.  The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw.  Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges.  The temporary fixation wires were then removed.  The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted.  Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed.  A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule.  The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially.  Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl.

The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.

The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection.  Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril.,After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion.  The foot was elevated off the table.  Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected.  A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate.  Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion.  A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision.  A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer.  All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade.  The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head.  The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it.  A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion.  Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex.,The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head.  Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved.  The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate.  Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment.  A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique.  Excellent rigid fixation was achieved.  A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head.  Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight.  The temporary fixation was removed.  A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw.  The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present.,A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge.  A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done.,After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy.  A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone.  A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone.  The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole.  The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved.  Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces.  Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint.  Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer.  #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion.  Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint.  The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches.  She is to follow with Dr. X.  She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise.  She was given prescription for Vicodin ES #25 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn one p.o. b.i.d.  500 mg.

Normal uterus, tubes, and ovaries.,PROCEDURE:  ,After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room, where spinal anesthetic was found to be adequate.  The patient was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient's previous Pfannenstiel scar incision was removed and the incision was carried through the underlying layer of fascia using the second knife.  The fascia was incised in the midline and the fascial incision was extended laterally using the second knife.  The rectus muscles were separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, grasped with hemostats, and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The bladder blade was then inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified, grasped with an Allis clamp and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  This incision was extended laterally and the bladder flap created digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted and a small transverse incision was made along the lower uterine segment.  This incision was extended laterally manually.  The amniotic fluid was ruptured at this point with clear fluid obtained.  The infant's head was delivered atraumatically.  The nose and mouth were both suctioned on delivery.  The cord was doubly clamped and cut.  The infant was handed off to the awaiting pediatrician.  Cord gases and cord bloods were obtained and sent.  The placenta was then removed manually and the uterus exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was reapproximated with #0 chromic in a running lock fashion.  A second layer of the same suture was used with excellent hemostasis.  Attention was now turned to the right fallopian tube, which was grasped with the Babcock and avascular space below the tube was entered using a hemostat.  The tube was doubly clamped using hemostat and the portion between the clamps was removed using Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends of the tube were cauterized using the Bovie and they were then tied off with #2-0 Vicryl.  Attention was then turned to the left fallopian tube, which was grasped with the Babcock and avascular space beneath the tube was entered using a hemostat.  The tube was then doubly clamped with hemostat and the portion of tube between them was removed using the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends of the tubes were cauterized and the tube was suture-ligated with #2-0 Vicryl.  There were some adhesions of the omentum to the bilateral adnexa.  These were carefully taken down using Metzenbaum scissors with excellent hemostasis noted.  The uterus was then returned to the abdomen and the bladder was cleared of all clots.  The uterine incision was reexamined and found to be hemostatic.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Several interrupted sutures of #3-0 chromic were placed in the subcutaneous tissue.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital.",

The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.

The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.","surgery, lumbar osteomyelitis, central intravenous access, subclavian, osteomyelitis, broviac catheter, catheter, toddler, intravenous,"

Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.

The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.

Carcinoma of the left upper lobe., Surgery, Bronchoscopy & Lobectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the left upper lobe.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.  The chest tubes were attached to the Pleur-Evac drainage and placed on suction at this time.  The patient was extubated in the room without difficulty and sent to Recovery in satisfactory.","surgery, ng tube, chest tubes, endotracheal tube, pulmonary vein, artery, aspiration, lobectomy, bronchoscopy, tumor, vein, bronchus, pulmonary,"

Limited left thoracotomy with partial pulmonary decortication and insertion of chest tubes x2.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Initially, the patient was intubated with a #6 French tube because of the presence of previous laryngectomy.  Because of this, I proceeded to use a pediatric bronchoscope, which provided limited visualization, but I was able to see the trachea and the carina and both left and right bronchial systems without significant pathology, although there was some mucus secretion that was aspirated.,Then, with the patient properly anesthetized and looking very stable, we decided to insert a larger endotracheal tube that allowed for the insertion of the regular adult bronchoscope.  Therefore, we were able to obtain a better visualization and see the trachea and the carina that were normal and also the left and right bronchial systems.  Some brownish secretions were obtained, particularly from the right side and were sent for culture and sensitivity, both aerobic and anaerobic fungi and acid fast.,Then, the patient was turned with left side up and prepped for a left thoracotomy.  He was properly draped.  I had recently re-inspected the CT of the chest and decided to make a limited thoracotomy of about 6 cm or so in the midaxillary line about the sixth intercostal space.  Immediately, it was evident that there was a large amount of pus in the left chest.  We proceeded to insert the suction catheters and we rapidly obtained about 1400 mL of frank pus.  Then, we proceeded to open the intercostal space a bit more with a Richardson retractor and it was immediately obvious that there was an abundant amount of solid exudate throughout the lung.  We spent several minutes trying to clean up this area.  Initially, I had planned only to drain the empyema because the patient was in a very poor condition, but at this particular moment, he was more stable and well oxygenated, and the situation was such that we were able to perform a partial pulmonary decortication where we broke up a number of loculations that were present and we were able to separate the lung from the diaphragm and also the pulmonary fissure.  On the upper part of the chest, we had limited access, but overall we obtained a large amount of solid exudate and we were able to break out loculations.  We followed by irrigation with 2000 cc of warm normal saline and then insertion of two #32 chest tubes, which are the largest one available in this institution; one we put over the diaphragm and the other one going up and down towards the apex.,The limited thoracotomy was closed with heavy intercostal sutures of Vicryl, then interrupted sutures of #0 Vicryl to the muscle layers, and I loosely approximately the skin with a few sutures of nylon because I am suspicious that the incision may become infected because he has been exposed to intrapleural pus.,The chest tubes were secured with sutures and then connected to Pleur-evac.  Then, the patient was transported.,Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was extubated in the operating room and he was transferred to the ICU to be admitted.

This morning, the patient developed worsening hypoxia with abundant sputum production requiring frequent suctioning from his ET tube.  The patient also had new-appearing atelectasis versus infiltrates in the right lower lobe of his lung on chest x-ray.  Given these findings, it was felt that bronchoscopy could further define source of secretions and send more appropriate specimen for culture if need be.,OPERATION:,  The patient was given additional fentanyl, Versed as well as paralytics for the procedure.  Small bronchoscope was inserted through the ET tube and to the trachea to the level of carina.  There was noted to be thick clear secretions adherent to the trachea walls as well as into the right mainstem bronchus.  Extensive secretions extended down into the secondary airways.  This was lavaged with saline and suctioned dry.  There is no overt specific occlusion of airways, nor was there any purulent-appearing sputum.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, and there was noted to be a small amount of similar-appearing secretions which was likewise suctioned and cleaned.  The bronchoscope was removed, and the patient was increased to PEEP of 10 on the ventilator.  Please note that prior to starting bronchoscopy, he was pre oxygenated with 100% O2.

Nebulized 4% lidocaine followed by nasal insufflation of lidocaine through the right naris and topical 4% lidocaine gel through the right naris, 4 mg of Versed was given at the start of the procedure and another 1 mg shortly after traversing the cords.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  With the patient breathing oxygen by nasal cannula, being monitored by noninvasive blood pressure cuff and continuous pulse oximetry, the Olympus bronchoscope was introduced through the right naris to the level of the cords.  The cords move normally with phonation and ventilation.  Two times 2 mL of 1% lidocaine were instilled on the cords and the cords were traversed.  Further 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was instilled in the trachea just distal to the cords, at mid trachea above the carina, and on the right, and on the left mainstem bronchus.  Scope was then introduced on to the left where immediately some hyperemia of the mucosa was noted.  Upper lobe and lingula were unremarkable.  There appeared to be some narrowing or tenting of the left lower lobe bronchus such that after inspection of the superior segment, one almost had to pop the bronchoscope around to go down the left mainstem.  This had been a change from the prior bronchoscopy of unclear significance.  Distal to this, there was no hyperemia or inspissated mucus or mucoid secretions or signs of infection.  The scope was wedged in the left lower lobe posterior basal segment and a BAL was done with good returns, which were faintly hemorrhagic.  The scope was then removed, re-introduced up to the right upper lobe, middle lobe, superior segment, right lower, anterior lateral, and posterior basal subsegments were all evaluated and unremarkable.

A rapid sequence induction was done.  He was intubated with a rigid scope.  Jet ventilation technique was carried out using a rigid and flexible scope.  A thorough airway inspection was carried out with findings as described above.,Dr. D was present in the operating room and we conferred on operative strategy and agreed that the best of strategy would be to first dilate the right main bronchus, cauterize it to control bleeding and then piecemeal removed the stent from distal to proximal.  This is the technique that was carried out in a painstaking fashion removing bits of the stent piecemeal with finally getting all of the visible stent out of the airway.  It should be noted that Dr. Donovan and I felt that two of the metallic stents were probably in place but we cannot be sure because of the terrible anatomy and the fact that the stent pieces were coming out twisted metal in fragments.  Nevertheless, all the visible stent was removed, and the airway was much better after with the dilation of balloon and the rigid scope.  We took measurements and decided to place stents in the trachea, left and right main bronchus using a Dumon Y-stent.  It was measured 18 mm in tracheal diameter and 14 mm in bronchial diameter.  The right main stem stent was 2.25 cm in length, the left main stem stent was 3 cm in length and the tracheal portion was 9 cm in length.  After it was placed, excellent placement was achieved with the proximal end of the stent 3 cm below the true vocal cords.

The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications.  The patient has history of urethral stricture.  The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had SCDs on.  The patient was given preop antibiotics.  The patient had done bowel prep the day before.  Transrectal ultrasound was performed.  The prostate was measured at about 32 gm.  The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc.  Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed.  Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient.  There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid.  Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate.  A total of 24 needles was used.  Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra.  Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed.  There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound.  There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position.  Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy.  Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure.  Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter.  The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture.  Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame.  We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in.  At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized.  The stricture was wide open.  The prostate was slightly enlarged.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder.  The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens.  At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed.

Visual field testing showed *% superior hemifield loss on the right, and *% superior hemifield loss on the left.  These field losses resolved with upper eyelid taping which simulates the expected surgical correction.  Photodocumentation also showed the upper eyelids resting on the upper eyelashes, as well as a decrease in the effective superior marginal reflex distance.  The risks, benefits, limitations, alternatives, and expected improvement in symptoms and visual field loss were discussed in preoperative evaluation.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, On the day of surgery, the surgical site and procedure were verified by the physician with the patient.  An informed consent was signed and witnessed.  EMLA cream was applied to the eyelids and eyebrow region for 10 minutes to provide skin anesthesia.  Two drops of topical proparacaine eye drops were placed on the ocular surface.  The skin was cleaned with alcohol prep pads.  The patient received 3 to 4 mL of 2% Lidocaine with epinephrine and 0.5% Marcaine mixture to each upper lid.  5 to 6 mL of local were also given to the brow region along the entire length.  Pressure was applied over each site for 5 minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for oculoplastic surgery.,The desired amount of redundant brow tissue to be excised was carefully marked with a surgical marking pen on each side.  The contour of the outline was created to provide a greater temporal lift.  Care was taken to preserve a natural contour to the brow shape consistent with the patient’s desired features.  Using a #15 blade, the initial incision was placed just inside the superior most row of brow hairs, in parallel with the follicle growth orientation.  The incision extended in a nasal to temporal fashion with the nasal portion incision being carried down to muscle and becoming progressively shallower toward the tail of the incision line.  The dimensions of the redundant tissue measured * horizontally and * vertically.  The redundant tissue was removed sharply with Westcott scissors.  Hemostasis was maintained with hand held cautery and/or electrocautery.  The closure was carried out in multiple layers.  The deepest muscular/subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 transparent nylon in a horizontal mattress fashion.  The intermediate layer was closed with 5-0 Vicryl similarly.  The skin was closed with 6-0 nylon in a running lock fashion.  Iced saline gauze pads were placed over the incision sites.  This completed the brow repair portion of the case.,Using a surgical marking pen, a vertical line was drawn from the superior punctum to the eyebrow.  An angled line was drawn from the ala of the nares to the lateral canthus edge and extending to the tail of the brow.  These lines served as the relative boundary for the horizontal length of the blepharoplasty incision.  The desired amount of redundant tissue to be excised was carefully pinched together with 0.5 forceps.  This tissue was outlined with a surgical marking pen.  Care was taken to avoid excessive skin removal near the brow region.  A surgical ruler was used to ensure symmetry.  The skin and superficial orbicularis were incised with a #15 blade on the first upper lid.  This layer was removed with Westcott scissors.,Hemostasis was achieved with high-temp hand held pen cautery.  The remaining orbicularis and septum were grasped superiorly and inferiorly on each side of the incision and tented upward.  The high temp cautery pen was then used to incise these layers in a horizontal fashion until preapeuronotic fat was identified.  * amount of central preaponeurotic fat was removed with cautery.  * amount of nasal fat pad was removed in the same fashion.  Care was taken to not disturb the levator aponeurosis.  A symmetric amount of fat was removed from each side.  Iced gauze saline was placed over the site and the entire procedure repeated on the fellow eyelid.  Skin hooks were placed on either side of the incision and the skin was closed in a continuous running fashion with 6-0 nylon.  Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment was placed over the incision site and on the ocular surface.  Saline gauze and cold packs were placed over the upper lids.  The patient was taken from the surgical suite in good condition.,DISCHARGE:,  In the recovery area the results of surgery were discussed with the patient and their family.

Risks including but not limited to bleeding, infection, vascular injury, cardiac perforation, stroke, myocardial infarction, the need for urgent cardiovascular surgery, and death were discussed with the patient.  The patient agreed both verbally and via written consent.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was transported to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the fasting state.  The region of the left deltopectoral groove was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Lidocaine 1% (20 mL) was administered to the area.  After achieving appropriate anesthesia, a percutaneous access of the left axillary vein was performed under fluoroscopy with two separate sticks.  Guidewires were advanced down into the left axillary vein.  Following this, a 4-inch long transverse incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue exposing the pectoral fascia and muscle beneath.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  Lidocaine 1% (10 mL) was administered to the medial aspect of the incision and a pocket was fashioned in the medial direction.  Using the more lateral of the guidewires, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator was removed and another wire was advanced down into the sheath.  The sheath was then backed up over the top of the two wires.  One wire was pinned to the drape and using the alternate wire, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced down into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A defibrillation lead was then advanced down into the atrium.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was then passed across the tricuspid valve and positioned in the apical septal location.  The active fix screw was deployed.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily and there was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  Using the wire that had been pinned to the drape, a 7-French side-arm sheath was advanced over this wire into the axillary vein.  The wire and dilator were removed.  An active pacing lead was then advanced down to the right atrium and the peel-away sheath was removed.  The lead was parked until a later time.  Using the separate access point, a 9-French side-arm sheath was advanced into the left axillary vein.  The dilator and wire were removed.  A curved outer sheath catheter as well as an inner catheter were advanced down into the area of the coronary sinus.  The coronary sinus was cannulated.  Inner catheter was removed and a balloon-tipped catheter was advanced into the coronary sinus.  A coronary sinus venogram was then performed.  It was noted that the most suitable location for lead placement was the middle cardiac vein.  This was cannulated and a passive lead was advanced over a Whisper EDS wire into a distal position.  Adequate pacing and sensing functions were established.  A 10-volt pacing was used temporarily.  There was no diaphragmatic stimulation.  The outer sheath was peeled away.  The 9 French sheath was then peeled away.  Suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  At this point, the atrial lead was then positioned in the right atrial appendage using a preformed J-curved stylet.  The lead body was turned several times and the lead was affixed to the tissue.  Adequate pacing and sensing function were established.  A suture sleeve was advanced to the entry point of the tissue and connected securely to the tissue.  The pocket was then washed with antibiotic-impregnated saline.  Pulse generator was obtained and connected securely to the leads.

The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc.  Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed.  Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed.  The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed.  Bladder was emptied.  Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa.  Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done.  Incision was made.  A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa.  The bladder cystocele was reduced.  Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal.  Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision.  The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed.  The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra.,The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material.  The urethra was coapted very nicely.  At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder.  There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings.  The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair.  The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion.  The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond.  Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement.  The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  After closure, Premarin cream was applied.  The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop.  The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition.,The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months.  The patient understood.

This incision was carried down to the area of the previous vasectomy.  A towel clip was placed around this.  Next the scarred area was dissected free back to normal vas proximally and distally.  Approximately 4 cm of vas was freed up.  Next the vas was amputated above and below the scar tissue.  Fine hemostats were used to grasp the adventitial tissue on each side of the vas, both the proximal and distal ends.  Both ends were then dilated very carefully with lacrimal duct probes up to a #2 successfully.  After accomplishing this, fluid could be milked from the proximal vas which was encouraging.,Next the reanastomosis was performed.  Three 7-0 Prolene were used and full thickness bites were taken through the muscle layer of the vas deferens and into the lumen.  This was all done with 3.5 loupe magnification.  Next the vas ends were pulled together by tying the sutures.  A good reapproximation was noted.  Next in between each of these sutures two to three of the 7-0 Prolenes were used to reapproximate the muscularis layer further in an attempt to make this fluid-tight.,There was no tension on the anastomosis and the vas was delivered back into the right hemiscrotum.  The subcuticular layers were closed with a running 3-0 chromic and the skin was closed with three interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.,Next an identical procedure was done on the left side.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.

Informed consent was obtained and we proceed with surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken into the operating room, placed in the supine position.  General anesthetic was administered.  Prophylactic dose of antibiotic was given.  Lines were placed by Anesthesia and then the head of the bed was turned to 100 degrees.  The patient was once more positioned and padded in the usual manner.  The incision was marked with the help of a marking pen and local anesthetic was infiltrated after prepping the area one time, then the definitive prep and draping of the area was done.,The procedure began with an incision through the full-thickness of the skin into the subcutaneous tissue down to the subgaleal plane.  The subgaleal plane was developed and reflected anteriorly and slightly posteriorly.  Hemostasis achieved with electrocautery.  Raney clips were applied to both flaps to prevent significant bleeding.  Then, we proceed with craniotomy part and Dr. Y proceeded with this part of the procedure.  I assisted her and this will be described in a different operative report.  Then, the area corresponding to the C-shaped osteotomy was marked and then we proceed in conjunction with Dr. Y to develop these osteotomies with the help of the Midas by retracting the contents of the skull at the level of the anterior fossa as well as the orbital contents with the help of a ribbon retractor.  The osteotomies were done with the Midas and some irrigation.  There was an osteotomy done at the level of the frontozygomatic suture just posterior to the frontozygomatic suture and then these osteotomies continued down intraorbitally and lateral through the zygoma to the level of the intraorbital rim.  This was done on both sides.  Hemostasis achieved with bone wax and electrocautery.  Once the osteotomies were completed, __________ of the osteotomy sites allowed advancements.  On the left side, there was a minor fracture to the superior orbital rim that was plated.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  The vulva and perineum appeared normal.  Laparoscopic findings revealed normal appearing uterus, fallopian tubes bilaterally as well as ovaries bilaterally.  There was a functional cyst on the left ovary.  There was filmy adhesion in the left pelvic sidewall.  There were two clear lesions consistent with endometriosis, one was on the right fallopian tube and the other one was in the cul-de-sac.  The uterosacrals and ovarian fossa as well as vesicouterine peritoneum were free of any endometriosis.  The liver was visualized and appeared normal.  The spleen was also visualized.,INDICATIONS: , This patient is a 34-year-old gravida 4, para-4-0-0-4 Caucasian female who desires permanent sterilization.  She recently had a spontaneous vaginal delivery in June and her family planning is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A bimanual exam was performed and the above findings were noted.  Prior to beginning the procedure, her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vagina and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum.  The cervix was dilated so that the uterine elevator could be placed.  Gloves were exchanged and attention was then turned to the anterior abdominal wall where the skin at the umbilicus was everted and using the towel clips, a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  The Veress needle was then inserted and using sterile saline ______ the pelvic cavity.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 bladed trocar was then placed and intraabdominal placement was confirmed with the laparoscope.  A second skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis and under direct visualization, a 7 mm bladed trocar was placed without difficulty.  Using the Hulka clip applicator, the left fallopian tube was identified, followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was then placed snugly against the uterus across the entire diameter of the fallopian tube.  A second Hulka clip was then placed across the entire diameter just proximal to this.  There was good hemostasis at the fallopian tube.  The right fallopian tube was then identified and followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was placed. snugly against the uterus across the entire portion of the fallopian tube in a 90 degree angle.  A second Hulka clip was placed just distal to this again across the entire diameter.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the abdomen was desufflated and after it was desufflated, the suprapubic port site was visualized and found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope and remaining trocars were then removed with good visualization of the peritoneum and fascia and the laparoscope was removed.  The umbilical incision was then closed with two interrupted #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The suprapubic incision was then closed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed and the single-toothed tenaculum site was found to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated that procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

The plane of injection was superficial and external to the orbital septum of the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally.,The face was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,After waiting a period of approximately ten minutes for adequate vasoconstriction, the previously outlined excessive skin of the right upper eyelid was excised with blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained with a bipolar cautery.  A thin strip of orbicularis oculi muscle was excised in order to expose the orbital septum on the right.  The defect in the orbital septum was identified, and herniated orbital fat was exposed.  The abnormally protruding positions in the medial pocket were carefully excised and the stalk meticulously cauterized with the bipolar cautery unit.  A similar procedure was performed exposing herniated portion of the nasal pocket.  Great care was taken to obtain perfect hemostasis with this maneuver.  A similar procedure of removing skin and taking care of the herniated fat was performed on the left upper eyelid in the same fashion.  Careful hemostasis had been obtained on the upper lid areas.  The lateral aspects of the upper eyelid incisions were closed with a couple of interrupted 7-0 blue Prolene sutures.,At the end of the operation the patient's vision and extraocular muscle movements were checked and found to be intact.  There was no diplopia, no ptosis, no ectropion.  Wounds were reexamined for hemostasis, and no hematomas were noted.  Cooled saline compresses were placed over the upper and lower eyelid regions bilaterally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to return home in satisfactory condition.","surgery, bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis, blepharoplasty, upper lid, bilateral upper lid, eyelid, bilateral upper lid blepharoplasty, upper lid blepharoplasty, eyelid dermatochalasis, lid blepharoplasty, orbital septum, upper eyelid, anesthesia, dermatochalasis, hemostasis"

The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity.  The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  Tourniquet time was 74 minutes.  A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated.  The _________ was identified.  It was incised.  The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found.  There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture.  This area was suctioned clean.  The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface.  At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon.  Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture.  Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously.  The radial tuberosity was palpated.  Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow.  A skin incision was made over this area.  Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split.,A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa.  The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision.  At this point, they were placed to the side.  Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated.  The tuberosity came into view.  The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection.  Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity.  Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture.  The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole.  The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated.  The suture was tied over the bone islands.  Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples.  The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples.  Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia.  A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position.  Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint.  Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately.  The patient was awakened.  He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity.

The most recent one which I performed quite a number of years ago that was complicated by a bone flap infection and he has had removal of his bone flap.  He has been without the bone flap for a number of years now but has finally decided that he wanted to proceed with a cranioplasty.  After discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, the decision was made to proceed with operative intervention in the form of a cranioplasty.  He had previously undergone a CT scan.  Premanufactured cranioplasty made for him that was sterile and ready to implant.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, an appropriate time out was performed.  We identified the patient, the location of surgery, the appropriate surgical procedure, and the appropriate implant.  He was given intravenous antibiotics with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Flagyl appropriately for antibiotic prophylaxis and sequential compression devices were used for deep venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.  The scalp was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A previous incision was reopened and the scalp flap was reflected forward.  We dissected off the dura and we were able to get a nice plane of dissection elevating the temporalis muscle along with the scalp flap.  We freed up the bony edges circumferentially, but except for the inferior frontal region where the vascularized pericranial graft took its vascular supply from we did not come across the base.  We did explore laterally and saw a little bit of the mesh on the lateral orbit.  Once we had the bony edges explored, we took the performed plate and secured it in a place with titanium plates and screws.  We had achieved good hemostasis.  The wound was closed in multiple layers in usual fashion over a Blake drain.  At the end of the procedure, all sponge and needle counts were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the incision.

After discussing the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient preoperatively, the patient voiced understanding and signed informed consent.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the right arm was circumferentially prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion.  A longitudinal incision was made from just above the antecubital crease along the medial aspect of the arm overlying the palpable thrill using a 15 blade knife.  The sharp dissection was then used to identify dissection created of the basilic vein from its surrounding tissues.  This was continued and the incision was elongated up the arm as the vein was exposed in a serial fashion.  Branch points were then taken down using multitude of techniques based upon the luminal diameter of the branch before transection.  The basilic vein was ultimately freed in its entirety from just above the antecubital crease to the axilla at the level of the axillary vein.  There was noted to be excellent flow through the vein.  A pocket was then created just lateral to the incision in the subcutaneous tissue.  The vein was then placed into this pocket securing with multiple interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bed of dissection of the basilic vein was then treated with fibrin sealant.  The subcutaneous tissue was then reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl sutures in interrupted fashion.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl suture for a subcuticular stitch.  Dermabond was applied to the incision.  Again, there was noted to be good palpable thrill throughout the superficialized vein.

Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter.  The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively.  The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time.  Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.,No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time.  The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass.  Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis.  Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature.  Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture.  Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic.  Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site.  Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction.  This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation.  This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision.  This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space.  Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition.  He will be discharged to home upon ability of the patient to have pain tolerance with Vicodin 1-2 as needed every six hours for pain and continue on Keflex antibiotics until gram stain culture proves otherwise.","surgery, incision and drainage, axillary mass excision, axillary dissection, hodgkin's disease, axillary mass, mass, incision, axillary,"

The patient has attempted conservative correction and injections with minimal improvement.  The patient desires surgical correction at this time.  The patient states that her pain has been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes.  At this time, the patient desires surgical intervention and correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A safety strap was placed across her waist for protection.,Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied around her left ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection.  After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose was administered to the patient for local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and a tourniquet was then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage.  The foot was then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet was draped.  The stockinet was then reflected.  Attention was then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace.  After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision was placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsals distally to and beyond the metatarsal head.  Then, using #15 blade the incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures.  Incision was deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade.  The incision was deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which was reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space was appreciated.  The individual branches of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digits plantarly.  These endings were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions.  Following this, the nerve was dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space.  Using careful meticulous dissection, there was noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fibers and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue.  This was also cut and removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve stump was identified and care was taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed.  Following this, the interspace was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portions of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection.  It was noted that no other portions of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending was embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly.  Following this, the interspace was packed using iodoform gauze packing and was closed in layers with the packing extruding from the wound.  Attention was then directed to the third interspace where in a manner as mentioned before.  A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm was made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head.  Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision was deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structures which were encountered.,The incision was deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal.  The dissection was deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this was reflected and the nerve fibers to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified.  These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions.  Care was then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region.  No other branches of the nerve were identified and the nerve in its entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area was removed.  The proximal portion of the nerve which remained was not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle as was done in the previous interspace.  Half of the nerve was transected proximally as was feasible and no exposed ending was noted.  Incision was then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline.  Following this, the incision wound was packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layers using as before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture.,Following this, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision was placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade.  The incision was then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect any neurovascular structures which were encountered.  Following this the incision was deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum was reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region.  After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head was achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane was performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal was shifted medially.  Following this, an OrthoSorb pin was retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and was cut off first with the lateral surfaces of bone.  OrthoSorb pin was noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head was in good alignment and position.  Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edges of bone laterally.  Following this, the periosteum was closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in layers using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture.  Upon completion of this, the foot was noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit.  The incisions in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage.  The tourniquet was then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minutes at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to end digits one through five of the left foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.  The patient was then given prescriptions for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily.  The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office.  The patient also given postoperative instructions and was placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minutes every hour as tolerated.  The patient also instructed to take her medications and prescriptions as directed.  She was given the emergency contact numbers.

The right lower extremity was protectively padded.  The left leg was propped with multiple blankets.  The hip was then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior incision was made on the posterolateral aspect of the left hip down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery.  Gluteus fascia was incised in line with a skin incision and the muscle was split posteriorly.  The external rotators were identified after removal of the trochanteric bursa.  Hemostat was utilized to separate the external rotators from the underlying capsule, they were then transected off from their attachment at the posterior intertrochanteric line.  They were then reflected distally.  The capsule was then opened in a T-fashion utilizing the cutting cautery.  Fraction hematoma exuded from the hip joint.  The cork screw was then impacted into the femoral head and it was removed from the acetabulum.  Bone fragments were removed from the neck and acetabulum.  The acetabulum was then inspected and noted to be free from debris.  The proximal femur was then delivered into the wound with the hip internally rotated.,A mortise chisel was then utilized to take the cancellous bone from the proximal femur.  The T-handle broach was then passed down the canal.  The canal was then sequentially broached up to a medium broach.  The calcar was then plained with the hand plainer.  The trial components were positioned into place.  The medium component fit fairly well with the medium 28 mm femoral head.  Once the trial reduction was performed, the hip was taken through range of motion.  There was physiologic crystalling with longitudinal traction.  There was no tendency towards dislocation with flexion of the hip past 90 degrees.  The trial implants were then removed.  The acetabulum was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The medium fenestrated femoral stem was prepared by placing a large segment of bone from the femoral head into the fenestration making it a little larger than the width of the implant to provide a press fit.  The implant was then impacted into place.  The 28 mm femoral head was impacted on the mortise stapler of the femoral stem followed by placement of the 50 mm bipolar cup.  The acetabulum was once again inspected, was free of debris.  The hip was reduced.  It was taken through full range of motion.  There was no tendency for dislocation.  The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Ethibond suture.  External rotators were then reapproximated to the posterior intertrochanteric line utilizing #1 Ethibond in a modified Kessler type stitch.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Gluteus fascia was approximated with interrupted #1 Ethibond.  Subcutaneous layers were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples.  A bulky dressing was applied to the wound.

After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg.  The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique.  The left ankle tourniquet was inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion.  A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal.  Provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction.  The same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using AO technique.  The wires were removed.  Fixation on the table was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical.  The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues.  The incision site was reinforced with Steri-Strips.  At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated.  The time was 45 minutes.

", Surgery, Atrioventricular Septal Defect ,"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 5-1/2-year-old with Down syndrome, complex heart disease consisting of atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, discontinuous pulmonary arteries and bilateral superior vena cava with a left cava draining to the coronary sinus and a right aortic arch.  As an infant, he was initially palliated with the right and modified Blalock-Taussig shunt in October of 2002 and underwent atrioventricular septal defect and repair of pulmonary artery unifocalization and homograft placement between the right ventricle and unifocalized pulmonary arteries.  He developed a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis for which on 07/20/2004, he underwent a bilateral balloon pulmonary arterioplasty and stent implantation at the San Diego at Children's Hospital.  This was followed on 09/13/2007 with replacement of pulmonary valve utilizing a 16-mm Contegra valve.  A recent echocardiogram demonstrated a significant branch of pulmonary artery stenosis with the predicted gradient of 41 to 55 mmHg and a well-functioning Contegra valve.  The lung perfusion scan from 11/14/2007 demonstrated 47% flow to the left lung and 53% flow to the right lung.  The patient underwent a repeat catheterization in consideration for further balloon angioplasty of the branch pulmonary arteries.,PROCEDURE: , After sedation, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing 50% oxygen throughout the case.  The patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures,Using a 7-French sheath, 6-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries.  This catheter was exchanged over wire.  A 5-French marker pigtail catheter was directed into the main pulmonary artery.  A second site of venous access was achieved in and the left femoral vein with the placement of 5-French sheath.,Using a 4-French sheath, a 4-French pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta and left ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery demonstrated stable stent configuration of the proximal branch pulmonary arteries with intimal ingrowth in the region of the proximal stents.  The distal right pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent section measuring 9.4 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the right pulmonary artery of 5.80 mm.  The distal left pulmonary measured approximately 10 mm in diameter with a mid stent measuring 10.3 mm and the proximal stent near the origin of the left pulmonary artery is 6.8 mm diameter.  The left femoral venous sheath was exchanged over wire for a 7-French sheath.  Guidewires were then advanced through the respective venous sheath into the branch pulmonary arteries and simultaneous balloon pulmonary arterioplasty was performed using the two Z-Med 12 x 4 cm balloon catheter was advanced into the branch of pulmonary arteries and inflated maximally to 9 hemispheres of pressure on 5 occasions near complete disappearance of proximal waist.  The balloon catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French Mistique catheter for pressure pull-back and measurement in the angiogram.  The catheter's wires were then removed and final hemodynamic assessment was made with the wedge catheter.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Cineangiograms were obtained with angiograph injection in the main pulmonary artery.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION:  ,Oxygen consumption was assumed to be in normal.  Mixed venous saturation that was not normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt.  Left side of the heart was mildly desaturated following a part to parenchymal lung disease with the partial pressure of oxygen of only 82 mmHg.  Aphasic right atrial pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was moderately elevated at 70% of systemic level and there was no obstruction into the proximal main pulmonary artery.  There was a 20 mmHg of peak systolic gradient across the branch pulmonary artery stents to the distal artery.  Right and left pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an A-wave similar to the mildly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 13 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic.  No outflow constriction to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal.  Vascular resistances were normal.  Angiogram with injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency, well functioning Contegra valve with no appreciable calcification.  The proximal narrowing of the distal main pulmonary artery was appreciated.  Neointimal ingrowth within the proximal stents were appreciated.  There is good distal growth of the pulmonary arteries.  Arborization appeared normal.  Levophase contrast returned to the heart appeared normal with a well-functioning left ventricle and the right aortic arch.  Following the branch pulmonary artery angioplasty that was increased in the mixed venous saturation, as well as an increase in the systemic arterial saturation.  Right ventricular systolic pressure felt slightly to 40 mmHg with an increase in systemic arterial pressure with a systolic pressure ratio of 54%.  The main pulmonary pressures remained similar.  There was 10 mmHg systolic gradient into the branch of pulmonary arteries.  There is an increase in distal branch of pulmonary arteries with the mean pressure increased from 16 mmHg to 21 mmHg.

One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system.,DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites.  The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg.  The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique.  The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated.  Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized.  The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely.,A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw.  The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal.  The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation.  The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal.  Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws.  The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy.  The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique.  One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length.  Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw.  To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally.  Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed.  The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe.  Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent.  Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical.  Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited.  The area was flushed copiously with saline.  Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision.  Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues.  All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized.  The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved.  Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal.  The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal.,The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw.  Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed.  Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent.  The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced.  Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent.  Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues.  Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision.  Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint.  The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto.  The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint.  A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed.  Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected.  The area was copiously flushed with saline.  The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe.  A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions.  Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical.  At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage.  The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes.  Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs.,The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels.  The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery.  The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment.","surgery, austin-akin bunionectomy, weil osteotomy, internal screw fixation, first right metatarsal, metatarsophalangeal joint, hammertoe deformity, extensor digitorum longus, austin akin bunionectomy, threaded cannulated screw, semi elliptical incisions, ankle tourniquet, surgical neck, cannulated screws, pip joint, proximal phalanx, fixation, metatarsophalangeal, proximal, screw, metatarsal, osteotomy, austin, joint, tourniquet, osteomed, phalanx, incision, "

He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.","surgery, knee and leg, anterolateral portal, emergency department, spinal needle, septic knee, knee joint, knee, emergency, department, gauge, spinal, needle, aspiration, anterolateral, portal, aspirated, fluid, septic, erythema, joint, aspiraion, "

The right anterior chest and supraclavicular fossa area, neck, and left side of chest were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated in the supraclavicular area and anterior chest along the planned course of the catheter.  The patient was placed into Trendelenburg position.,The right internal jugular vein was accessed by a supraclavicular 19-gauge, thin-walled needle as demonstrated by easy withdrawal of venous blood on the first pass of the needle.  Under fluoroscopic control, a J-wire was advanced into the right atrium.  The needle was removed and the skin puncture site enlarged to about 8 mm with the scalpel.  A second incision was made 5 cm inferior to the right midclavicular line, through which an Ash split catheter was advanced, using the tunneling rod, in a gently curving pass to exit the skin of the neck incision.  The tunneling needle was removed and the catheter split up to the marker as indicated in the recommended use of the catheter.,Sequential dilators were advanced over the J-wire under fluoroscopic control to dilate the subcutaneous tunnel followed by advancement of a dilator and sheath into the right superior vena cava under fluoroscopic control.  The dilator and wire were removed, leaving the sheath in position, through which a double-lumen catheter was advanced into the central venous system.  The sheath was peeled away, leaving the catheter into position.  Each port of the catheter was flushed with dilute heparinized saline.,The patient was returned to the flat position.  The catheter was secured to the skin of the anterior chest using 2-0 Ethilon suture placed through the suture ""wings."",The neck incision was closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure and pressure dressing applied.

Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin.  His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis.  Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure.,This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  He understood them well.  All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues.  This was made through the prior incision site.  There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site.  Medial and lateral flaps were then made.  The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed.  Effusion within the knee was noted.  All hematoma was evacuated.  I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene.  Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution.  Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue.  A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position.  The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee.  Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline.  The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner.  The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples.  Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint.,No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.

He has had a positive symptomology of locking and pain since then.  He had no frank instability to it, however.,GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , We did find a tear to the medial meniscus as well as a large area of chondromalacia to the medial femoral condyle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room.  The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Tourniquet was applied to the left thigh with adequate Webril padding, not inflated at this time.  After the left lower extremity had been prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, we applied an Esmarch tourniquet, exsanguinating the blood and inflated the tourniquet to 325 mmHg for a total of 19 minutes.  We established the lateral port of the knee with #11 blade scalpel.  We put in the arthroscopic trocar, instilled with water and inserted the camera.,On inspection of the patellofemoral joint, it was found to be quite smooth.  Pictures were taken there.  There was no evidence of chondromalacia, cracking, or fissuring of the articular cartilage.  The patella was well centered over the trochlear notch.  We then directed the arthroscope to the medial compartment of the knee.  It was felt that there was a tear to the medial meniscus.  We also saw large area of chondromalacia with grade-IV changes to bone over the medial femoral condyle.  This area was debrided with forceps and the arthroscopic shaver.  The cartilage was also smoothened over the medial femoral condyle.  This was curetted after the medial meniscus had been trimmed.  We looked into the notch.  We saw the ACL appeared stable, saw attachments to tibial as well as the femoral insertion with some evidence of laxity, wear and tear.  Attention then was taken to the lateral compartment with some evidence of tear to the lateral meniscus and the arterial surface of both the tibia as well as the femur were pristine in the lateral compartment.  All instruments were removed.  All loose cartilaginous pieces were suctioned from the knee and water was suctioned at the end.  We removed all instruments.  Marcaine was injected into the portal sites.  We placed a sterile dressing and stockinet on the left lower extremity.  He was transferred to the gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.","surgery, medial meniscoplasty, arthroscopic, chondroplasty, arthroscopy, medial femoral condyle, medial meniscus, knee, meniscal, cartilage, meniscoplasty, meniscus, chondromalacia, condyle, femoral"

Biopsy and culturing the right shoulder.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient had done well after a previous total shoulder arthroplasty performed by Dr. X.  However, the patient was lifted with subsequent significant pain and apparent tearing of his subscapularis.  Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed with the patient at length including, but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, incomplete return of function, continued instability, retearing of the tendon, need for revision of his arthroplasty, permanent nerve or artery damage, etc.  The patient understood and wished to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  ,1.

Right total shoulder arthroplasty (Biomet system).,3.  Diffuse synovitis, right shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was anesthetized in the supine position.  A Foley catheter was placed in his bladder.  He was then placed in a beach chair position.  He was brought to the side of the table and the torso secured with towels and tape.  His head was then placed in the neutral position with no lateral bending or extension.  It was secured with paper tape over his forehead.  Care was taken to stay off his auricular cartilages and his orbits.  Right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was given antibiotics well before the beginning of the procedure to decrease any risk of infection.  Once he had been prepped and draped with the standard prep, he was prepped a second time with a chlorhexidine-type skin prep.  This was allowed to dry and the skin was then covered with Ioban bandages also to decrease his risk of infection.,Also, preoperatively, the patient had his pacemaker defibrillator function turned off as a result during this case.  Bipolar type cautery had to be used as opposed to monopolar cautery.,The patient's deltopectoral incision was then opened and extended proximally and distally.  The patient had significant amount of scar already in this interval.  Once we got down to the deltoid and pectoralis muscle, there was no apparent cephalic vein present, as a result the rotator cuff interval had to be developed through an area of scar.  This created a significant amount of bleeding.  As a result a very slow and meticulous dissection was performed to isolate his coracoid and then his proximal humerus.  Care was taken to stay above the pectoralis minor and the conjoint tendon.  The deltoid had already started to scar down the proximal humerus as a result a very significant amount of dissection had to be performed to release the deltoid from proximal humerus.  Similarly, the deltoid insertion had to be released approximately 50% of its width to allow us enough mobility of the proximal humerus to be able to visualize the joint or the component.  It was clear that the patient had an avulsion of the subscapularis tendon as the tissue on the anterior aspect of the shoulder was very thin.  The muscle component of the subscapularis could be located approximately 1 cm off the glenoid rim and approximately 3 cm off the lesser tuberosity.  The soft tissue in this area was significantly scarred down to the conjoint tendon, which had to be very meticulously released.  The brachial plexus was identified as was the axillary nerve.  Once this was completed, an arthrotomy was then made leaving some tissue attached to the lesser tuberosity in case it was needed for closure later.  This revealed sanguineous fluid inside the joint.  We did not feel it was infected based upon the fluid that came from the joint.  The sutures for the subscapularis repair were still located in the proximal humerus with no tearing through the bone, which was fortunate because in that we could use the bone later for securing the sutures.  The remaining sutures were seen to be retracted medially to an area of the subscapularis as mentioned previously.  Some more capsule had to be released off the inferior neck in order for us to gain exposure during the scarring.  This was done also very meticulously.  The upper one half of the latissimus dorsi tendon was also released.  Once this was completed, the humerus could be subluxed enough laterally that we could remove the head.  This was done with no difficulty.  Fortunately, the humeral component stayed intact.  There were some exudates beneath the humeral head, which were somewhat mucinous.  However, these do not really appear to be infected, however, we sent them to pathology for a frozen section.  This frozen section later returned as possible purulent material.  I discussed this personally with the pathologist at that point.  We told him that the procedure is only 3 weeks old, but he was concerned that there might be more white blood cells in the tissue than he would expect.  As a result, all the mucinous exudates were carefully removed.  We also performed a fairly extensive synovectomy of the joint primarily to gain vision of the components, but also we irrigated the joint throughout the case with antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  At that point, we also had sent portions of this mucinous material to pathology for a stat Gram stain.  This came back as no organisms seen.  We also sent portions for culture and sensitivity both aerobic and anaerobic.,Once this was completed, attention was then directed to the glenoid.  The patient had significant amount of scar already.  The subscapularis itself was significantly scarred down to the anterior rim.  As a result, the adhesions along the anterior edge were released using a knife.  Also adhesions in the subcoracoid space area were released very carefully and meticulously to prevent any injury to the brachial plexus.  Two long retractors were placed medially to protect the brachial plexus during all portions of suturing of the subscapularis.  The subscapularis was then tagged with multiple number 2 Tycron sutures.  Adhesions were released circumferentially and it was found that with the arm in internal rotation about neutral degrees, the subscapularis could reach the calcar region without tension.  As a result, seven number 2 Tycron sutures were placed from the bicipital groove all the way down to the inferior calcar region of the humerus.  These all had excellent security in bone.  Once the joint had been debrided and irrigated, the real humeral head was then placed back on the proximal humerus.  Care was taken to remove fluid off the Morse taper.  The head was then impacted.  It should be noted that we tried multiple head sizes to see if a smaller or larger head size might be more appropriate for this patient.  Unfortunately, any of the larger head sizes would overstep the joint and any smaller sizes would not give good coverage to the proximal humerus.  As a result, it was felt to place the offset head back on the humerus, we did insert a new component as opposed to using the old component.  The old component was given to the family postoperatively.,With the arm in internal rotation, the Tycron sutures were then placed through the subscapularis tendon in the usual horizontal mattress fashion.  Also, it should be noted that the rotator cuff interval had to be released as part of the exposure.  We started the repair by closing the rotator cuff interval.  Anterior and posterior translation was then performed and was found to be very stable.  The remaining sutures were then secured through the subscapularis tendon taking care to make sure that very substantial bites were obtained.  This was then reinforced with the more flimsy tissue laterally being sewn into the tissue around the bicipital tuberosity essentially provided us with a two-layer repair of the subscapularis tendon.  After the tendon had been repaired, there was no tension on repair until 0 degrees external rotation was reached with the arm to the side.  Similarly with the arm abducted 90 degrees, tension was on repair at 0 degrees of external rotation.  It should be noted that the wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic impregnated irrigation.  The rotator cuff interval was closed with multiple number 2 Tycron sutures.  It was reinforced with 0 Vicryl sutures.  Two Hemovac drains were then placed inferiorly at the deltoid.  The deltopectoral interval was then closed with 0 Vicryl sutures.  A third drain was placed in the subcutaneous tissues to prevent any infections or any fluid collections.  This was sewn into place with the drain pulled out superiorly.  Once all the sutures have been secured and the drain visualized throughout this part of the closure, the drain was pulled distally until it was completely covered.  There were no signs that it had been tagged or hung up by any sutures.,The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted with 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin was closed with staples.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to the intensive care unit in stable and satisfactory condition.,Due to the significant amount of scar and bleeding in this patient, a 22 modifier is being requested for this case.  This was a very difficult revision case and was significantly increased in technical challenges and challenges in the dissection and exposure of this implant compared to a standard shoulder replacement.  Similarly, the repair of the subscapularis tendon presented significantly more challenges than that of a standard rotator cuff repair because of the implant.  This was being dictated for insurance purposes only and reflects no inherent difficulties with this case.  The complexity and the time involved in this case was approximately 30% greater than that of a standard shoulder replacement or of a rotator cuff repair.  This is being dictated to indicate this was a revision case with significant amount of scar and bleeding due to the patient's situation with his pacemaker.  This patient also had multiple medical concerns, which increased the complexity of this case including the necessity to place him in intensive care unit postoperatively for observation.","surgery, arthrotomy, repair of torn subscapularis tendon, glenohumeral joint, biomet system, arthroplasty, diffuse synovitis, proximal humerus, torn subscapularis tendon, subscapularis tendon, rotator cuff, humerus, sutures, tendon, head, shoulder, subscapularis, torn,"

Capsular shift, left shoulder (Mitek suture anchors; absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures).,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: , The patient was seen multiple times preoperatively and found to have chronic instability of her shoulder.  Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed in length including but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, continued instability, recurrent instability, medical complications, surgical complications, and anesthesia complications.  The patient understood and wishes to proceed.,PREOP DIAGNOSIS: , Anterior instability, left shoulder.,POSTOP DIAGNOSES:,1.  Anterior instability, left shoulder.,2.  Grade 4 chondromalacia, 10% humeral head, chondral defect 1 cm squared, left shoulder.,3.  Type 1 superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder.,4.  Anteroinferior glenoid erosions 10% bony surface, left shoulder.,5.  Bankart lesion, left shoulder.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and both shoulders examined systematically.  She had full range of motion with no joint adhesions.  She had equal range of motion bilaterally.  She had Hawkins 2 anteriorly and posteriorly in both shoulders with a grade 1 sulcus sign in both shoulders.  This was the same when the arm was in neutral or in external rotation.  The patient was then turned to right lateral decubitus position, axillary roll was placed, and beanbag was inflated.  Peroneal nerve was well protected.  All bony prominences were well protected.,The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The patient was given antibiotics well before the start of the procedure to decrease the risk of infection.  The arm was placed in a arm holder with 10 pounds of traction.  A posterior portal was created in the usual manner by isolating gently with the spinal needle, it was insufflated with 30 cubic centimeters of saline.  A small incision was made after infiltrating the skin with Marcaine and epinephrine.  The scope was introduced into the shoulder with no difficulty.  It was then examined systematically.  The patient did have diffuse synovitis throughout her shoulder.  Her posterior humeral head showed an enlarged bold spot with some other areas of chondromalacia on the posterior head.  She also had an area 1 cm in diameter, which was on more central portion of the head and more inferiorly which appeared to be more of an impaction-type injury.  This had some portions of fibrillated and loose cartilage, hanging from the edges.  These were later debrided, but the dissection was proximally 10 to 15% of the humeral surface.,The biceps tendon appeared to be normal.  The supraspinatus, infraspinatus tendons were normal.  The inferior pouch was normal with no capsular tearing and no HAGL lesions.  The posteroinferior labrum was normal as well as the posterosuperior labrum.  There was some fraying in the posterosuperior labrum, which was later debrided.  It was found essentially to be a type 1 lesion anteriorly and superiorly.  The anterosuperior labrum appeared to be detached, which appeared to be more consistent with a sublabral hole.  The middle glenohumeral ligament was present as an entire sheath, but attach to the labrum.  The labrum did appeared to be detached from the anterior glenoid from the 11 o'clock position all the way down to the 6 o'clock position.  The biceps anchor itself was later probed and found to be stable and normal.  The subscapularis tendon was normal.  The anterior band of the glenohumeral ligament was present, but it was clearly avulsed off the glenoid.  There was some suggestion of anteroinferior bony erosions, which was later substantiated when the shoulder was opened.  The patient was missing about 10 to 15% of her anteroinferior glenoid rim.  The patient had a positive drive-through sign.,The arm was then moved to lateral and placed through range of motion.  There was contact of the rotator cuff to the superior glenoid in flexion at 115 degrees, maximum flexion was 150 degrees.  The arm abducted and externally rotated.  There was contact to the rotator cuff with posterosuperior labrum.  This occurred with the arm position of 90 degrees with abduction at 55 degrees of external rotation.  It should be noted that the maximum abduction is 150 degrees and with the arm abducted 90 degrees, maximum external rotation was 95 degrees.  The patient did have a positive relocation maneuver.  The posterior labrum did appear to tilt-off, but did not appear to peel off.,The arm was then placed back in the arm holder.  Anterior portal was created with Wissinger rod.  A blue cannula was inserted into the shoulder without difficulty.  Shaver was introduced in the labrum.  Also the area of chondromalacia as mentioned above was debrided.  The labrum was found to be stable with only a type 1 SLAP lesion, and there was no evidence as there was really a type 2 SLAP lesion.  The instruments were then removed along with excess fluid.  The posterior portals were closed with single 4-0 nylon suture.  The anterior portal was left open.  The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the extremity was reprepped and draped in anticipation of performing open capsular shift.,The patient's anterior incision made just lateral to the coracoid in the skin line.  Mediolateral skin flaps were developed, and cephalic vein was identified and protected throughout the case.  The interval was developed down the clavipectoral fascia.  The conjoined tendon was retracted medially and the deltoid laterally.  The patient's subscapularis was intact, and the subscapularis split was then made between the upper one half and lower one half in line with muscle fibers.  The capsule could easily be detached from the muscle, and the interval developed very easily.  A retractor was placed inferiorly to protect the axillary nerve.  Then Gelpi retractor was used to hold the subscapularis split open.,Next, an arthrotomy was made down at the 9 o'clock position.  The labrum was identified and found to be attached all the way down to 6 o'clock position.  The inferior flap was then created in a usual manner and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture.  The patient's glenoid rim did have some erosion as mentioned above with some bone loss and flattening.  This was debrided with the soft tissue.  Three Mitek suture anchors were then placed into the glenoid rim right at the margin of articular cartilage to the scapular neck.  These were absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures.  They had excellent fixation once they had been placed.,Next, the capsular shift and Bankart repair were performed in the usual manner with the number 2 Ti-Cron sutures as an outside in and then inside out technique.  This brought the capsule right up to the edge of the glenoid rim.  With the arm in internal rotation and posterior pressure on the head, the capsule was then secured to the rim with no difficulty under direct visualization.  The capsule did come right up into the joint as expected with this type of repair.  The superior flap was then closed, the inferior flap over the superior anchor.  The interval between two flaps was closed with multiple number 2 Ti-Cron sutures.  Once this has been completed, there was no tension on the repair with the arm to side until 10 degrees of external rotation was reached.  The arm abducted 90 degrees.  There was tension on the repair until 20 degrees of external rotation reached.,The wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic-impregnated irrigation.  The subscapularis split was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures.  The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with number 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Prolene, reinforced with Steri-Strips.  A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer.  The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition.","surgery, diagnostic arthroscopy, chondral injury, debridement, superior glenoid, arthrotomy, bankart lesion, capsular shift, mitek suture, absorbable anchors, anterior instability, chondromalacia, superior labrum, glenoid erosion, glenoid rim, external rotation, glenoid, labrum, shoulder, arthroscopy, "

This was done under a local and IV sedation via the Anesthesia Department.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:,  This is a 37-year-old African-American male with a mass present at the posterolateral aspect of his right knee.  On aspiration, it was originally attempted to no avail.  There was a long-standing history of this including two different MRIs, one about a year ago and one very recently both of which did not delineate the mass present.  During aspiration previously, the patient had experienced neuritic type symptoms down his calf, which have mostly resolved by the time that this had occurred.  The patient continued to complain of pain and dysfunction to his calf.  This was discussed with him at length.  He wished this to be explored and the mass excised even though knowing the possibility that they would not change his pain pattern with the potential of reoccurrence as well as the potential of scar stiffness, swelling, and peroneal nerve palsy.  With this, he decided to proceed.,Upon observation preoperatively, the patient was noted to have a hard mass present to the posterolateral aspect of the right knee.  It was noted to be tender.  It was marked preoperatively prior to an anesthetic.  Upon dissection, the patient was noted to have significant thickening of the posterior capsule.  The posterolateral aspect of the knee above the posterolateral complex at the gastroc attachment to the lateral femoral condyle.  There was also noted to be prominence of the lateral femoral condyle ridge.  The bifurcation at the tibial and peroneal nerves were identified and no neuroma was present.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was laid supine upon the operating table.  After receiving IV sedation, he was placed prone.  Thigh tourniquet was placed.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  A transverse incision was carried down across the crease with a mass had been palpated through skin and subcutaneous tissue after exsanguination of the limb and tourniquet utilized.  The nerve was identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  Both nerves were identified and carefully retracted throughout the case.  There was noted to be no neuroma present.  This was taken down until the gastroc was split.  There was gross thickening of the joint capsule and after arthrotomy, a section of the capsule was excised.  The lateral femoral condyle was then osteophied.  We then smoothed off with a rongeur.  After this, we could not palpate any mass whatsoever placing pressure upon the area of the nerve.  Tourniquet was deflated.  It was checked again.  There was no excessive swelling.  Swanson drain was placed to the depth of the wound and interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and #4-0 nylon was utilized for skin closure.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing.  Digits were warm _______ pulses distally at the end of the case.  The tourniquet as stated has been deflated prior to closure and hemostasis was controlled.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded.","surgery, soft tissue mass, osteophyte, lateral femoral condyle, excision, capsular mass, arthrotomy, ostectomy, knee, soft tissue, femoral condyle, mass, subcutaneous, capsular, tourniquet, femoral, condyle,"

There was some softening and loss of the articular cartilage over the glenoid.  The labrum was ________ attached permanently to the glenoid.  The biceps tendon was nonsubluxable.  Upon ranging of the shoulder in internal and external rotation showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear on the articular side.  Subacromial space did show excessive soft tissue causing some overstuffing of the subacromial space.  There was reconstitution of the bursa noted as well.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 51-year-old female had left shoulder pain of chronic nature who has had undergone prior rotator cuff debridement in May with partial pain relief and has had continued pain in the left shoulder.  MRI shows partial rotator cuff tear.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in a beachchair position.  After all bony prominences were adequately padded, the head was placed in the headholder with no excessive extension in the neck on flexion.  The left extremity was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The #18 gauge needles were inserted into the left shoulder to locate the AC joint, the lateral aspect of the acromion as well as the pass of the first trocar to enter the shoulder joint from the posterior aspect.  We took an #11 blade scalpel and made a small 1-cm skin incision posteriorly approximately 4-cm inferior and medial to the lateral port of the acromion.  A blunt trocar was used to bluntly cannulate the joint and we put the camera into the shoulder at that point of the joint and instilled sterile saline to distend the capsule and begin our arthroscopic assessment of the shoulder.  A second port was established superior to the biceps tendon anteriorly under direct arthroscopic visualization using #11 blade on the skin and inserted bluntly the trocar and the cannula.  The operative findings found intra-articularly were as described previously gross operative findings.  We did not see any evidence of acute pathology.  We then removed all the arthroscopic instruments as well as the trocars and tunneled subcutaneously into the subacromial space and reestablished the portal and camera and inflow with saline.  The subacromial space was examined and found to have excessive soft tissue and bursa that was in the subacromial space that we debrided using arthroscopic shaver after establishing a lateral portal.  All this was done and hemostasis was achieved.  The rotator cuff was examined from the bursal side and showed no evidence of tears.  There was some fraying out laterally near its attachment over the greater tuberosity, which was debrided with the arthroscopic shaver.  We removed all of our instruments and suctioned the subacromial space dry.  A #4-0 nylon was used on the three arthroscopic portal and on the skin we placed sterile dressing and the arm was placed in an arm sling.  She was placed back on the gurney, extubated and taken to the PACU in stable condition.","surgery, subacromial space, arthroscopic, biceps tendon, labrum, glenoid, cartilage, partial rotator cuff tear, rotator cuff tear, shoulder arthroscopy, rotator cuff, arthroscopy, shoulder, tissue, subacromial, rotator, cuff,"

There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove.  The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle.  The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen.  The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact.  Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,PROCEDURE: , On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital.  She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department.  Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions.  Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution.  Intraoperative pictures were obtained.  The above findings were noted.  Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region.  Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris.  Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal.  An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal.  A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie.  Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery.  Next, the knee was suctioned dry.  An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity.  Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg.  An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee.  The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery.  The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision.  The patellar tendon was identified.  The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris.  Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact.  The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle.  It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin.  Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle.  There was excellent fixation noted.  The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees.  She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length.  The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry.  The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella.  The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl.  Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture.  Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities.  She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension.  It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet.  She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition.,Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint.  She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia.","surgery, diagnostic arthroscopy, patellofemoral malalignment syndrome, cannulated, partial chondroplasty, retinacular, chondromalacia patella, tibial tubercle, patella, tubercle, arthroscopy, tourniquet, chondroplasty, chondromalacia, patellofemoral, "

This was done under a interscalene block anesthetic and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beachchair position.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS:  ,This is a 54-year-old white female suffering an increasing right shoulder pain for a few months prior to surgical intervention.  She had an injury to her right shoulder when she fell off a bike.  She was diagnosed preoperatively with a rotated cuff tear.,Intra-articularly besides we noted a large SLAP lesion, superior and posterior to the attachment of the glenoid labrum from approximately 12:30 back to 10:30.  This acted as a peel-back type of mechanism and was displaced into the joint beyond the superior rim of the glenoid.  This was an obvious avulsion into subchondral bone with bone exposed.  The anterior aspect had degenerative changes, but did not have evidence of avulsion.  The subscapular was noted to be intact.  On the joint side of the supraspinatus, there was noted to be a laminated type of tearing to the rotated cuff to the anterior and mid-aspect of the supraspinatus attachment.,This was confirmed subacromially.  The patient had a type-I plus acromion in outlet view and thus it was elected to not perform a subacromial decompression, but soft tissue release of the CA ligament in a releasing resection type fashion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed supine upon the operative table after she was given interscalene and then general anesthesia by the Anesthesia Department.  She was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created from outside the ends, posterior to the scope and anteriorly for an intraoperative portal and then laterally.  She had at least two other portals appropriate for both repair mechanisms described above.,Attention was then turned to the SLAP lesion.  The edges were debrided both on the bony side as well as soft tissue side.  We used the anterior portal to lift up the mechanism and created a superolateral portal through the rotator cuff and into the edge of the labrum.  Further debridement was carried out here.  A drill hole was made just on the articular surface superiorly for a knotless anchor.  A pull-through suture of #2 fiber wire was utilized with the ________.  This was pulled through.  It was tied to the leader suture of the knotless anchor.  This was pulled through and one limb of the anchor loop was grabbed and the anchor impacted with a mallet.  There was excellent fixation of the superior labrum.  It was noted to be solid and intact.  The anchor was placed safely in the bone.  There was no room for further knotless or other anchors.  After probing was carried out, hard copy Polaroid was obtained.,Attention was then turned to the articular side for the rotator cuff.  It was debrided.  Subchondral debridement was carried out to the tuberosity also.  Care was taken to go to the subchondral region but not beyond.  The bone was satisfactory.,Scope was then placed in the subacromial region.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with in the lateral portal.  This was done throughout as well as in the gutters anterolaterally and posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out further to the rotator cuff.  Two types of fixation were carried out, one with a superolateral portal a drill hole was made and anchor of the _knotless suture placed after PDS leader suture placed with a Caspari punch.  There was an excellent reduction of the tear posteriorly and then anteriorly.  Tendon to tendon repair was accomplished by placing a fiber wire across the tendon and tying sutured down through the anterolateral portal.  This was done with a sliding stitch and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Attention was then turned to the CA ligament.  It was released along with periosteum and the undersurface of the anterior acromion.  The CA ligament was not only released but resected.  There was noted to be no evidence of significant spurring with only a mostly type-I acromion.  Thus, it was not elected to perform subacromial decompression for bone with soft tissue only.  A pain buster catheter was placed separately.  It was cut to length.  An interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closure.  A 0.5% Marcaine was instilled subacromially.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient's arm was placed in a arm sling.  She was transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,2.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,3.  Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.  Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position.  We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times.  The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery.  We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle.  This consisted of 60 cc of fluid.  We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint.  Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed.  We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint.,We found the articular surface to be in good condition.  There was a superior labral tear (SLAP).  This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal.  We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear.  We then drained the glenohumeral joint.  We redirected our camera into the subacromial space.  An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior.,We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver.  The bursa was extensively debrided.  We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached.  The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair.  Pictures were taken.,Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed.  It was carefully positioned.  Pictures were taken.  We then drained the joint.  All instruments were removed.  The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively.  All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures.,Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump.  ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied.  A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder.  The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.

After discussing alternatives of the care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Preoperatively, the patient did not have limitation of motion.  He had gross weakness to his supraspinatus, mildly to the infraspinatus and subscapularis upon strength testing prior to his anesthetic.,Intraarticularly, the patient had an 80% biceps tendon tear that was dislocated.  His rotator interval was resolved as well as his subscapularis with tearing.  The supraspinatus was completely torn, retracted back beyond the level of the labrum and approximately one-third or so of the infraspinatus was involved with the remaining portion being greatly thinned as far as we could observe.  Glenoid labrum had degenerative tear in the inferior surface.  Gross chondromalacia was present to approximately 50% of the humeral head and approximately the upper 40% of the glenoid surface.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department, he was safely placed in a modified beachchair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The portals were created outside the end posteriorly and then anteriorly.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out with the above-noted findings.  The shaver was placed anteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum tear and the last 20% of the biceps tendon tear was completed.  Debridement was carried out to the end or attachment of the bicep itself.,Debridement was carried out to what could be seen of the remaining rotator cuff there, but then the scope was redirected in a subacromial direction and gross bursectomy carried out.  Debridement was then carried out to the rotator cuff remaining tendon near the tuberosity.  No osteophytes were present.  Because of the massive nature of the tear, the CA ligament was maintained and there were no substantial changes to the subacromial region to necessitate burring.  There was concern because of instability that could be present at the end of this.,Another portal was created laterally to do all of this.  We did what we could to mobilize all sections of the rotator cuff, superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly.  We took this back to the level of coracoid base.  We released the coracohumeral ligament basically all but there was no excursion basically all to the portion of the rotator cuff torn.  Because of this, further debridement was carried out.  Debridement had been previously carried out to the humeral head as well as glenoid surface to debride the chondromalacia and take this down to the smooth edge.  Care was taken to not to debride deeper than that.  This was done prior to the above.,All instrumentation was removed.  A Pain-Buster catheter was placed into a separate anterolateral portal cut to length.  Interrupted #4-0 nylon was utilized for portal closures.  Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, Elastoplast tape were placed for a compression dressing.,The patient's arm was placed in an arm sling.  He was transferred to his cart and to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is quite guarded because of the above-noted pathology.","surgery, modified beachchair position, rotator cuff tear, glenoid labrum tear, glenohumeral joint, interscalene block, glenoid labrum, rotator cuff, rotator, debridement, glenoid, shoulder, tear, arthroscopy, arthroscopic, tenotomy, glenohumeral, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, chondromalacia, biceps, labrum, cuff, "

She also had medial bordered scapular pain unrelated directly to the present problem.  She had plus minus SLAP lesion testing preoperatively.,Operative findings in the joint included labrum was intact, long head of the biceps intact, laxity of 1+ all around, but clinically intact and without laxity.  Subacromially, type-II plus acromion and no evidence of significant rotator cuff tear with scuffing only.,She also had evidence of calcium deposition in the CA ligament and undersurface of the AC joint.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, she was placed in modified beachchair position.  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside the end, anterior and posterior, posterior and anterior, and subsequently laterally.  A full and complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint with the above noted findings.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was placed.  A lateral portal was created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out.  This was done with a 4.2 meniscal shaver as well as a hot Bovie.  Calcium deposition mentioned was removed.  With the rotator cuff intact, the periosteum was burned off the undersurface of the acromion and the CA ligament released anteriorly.  A subacromial decompression sequentially from laterally to medially was then carried out.  There was an excellent decompression.  Debridement was carried out to the bursa.

After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  All bony prominences were padded.  The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar.,Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum.  Subacromial space was entered.  Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back.  It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur.  Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact.  Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed.  The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out.  The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris.  The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene.  Sterile compressive dressing applied.,The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep.,The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes.  Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis.  Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures.,Cautery was used for hemostasis.  The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down.  The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well.  The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated.,Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars.  After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus.  These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver.  There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee.  There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition.",

The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel.  His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest.  The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner.  A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula.  The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint.  There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock.  The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule.  The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area.  The biceps tendon was noted to be intact.  The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved.  The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head.  The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact.  The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury.  There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch.  Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum.  Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position.  A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position.  The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable.  With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks.  An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position.  Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area.  At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary.  The arthroscopic instruments were removed.  An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold.  The skin incision was taken down through the skin.  Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis.  The deltopectoral fascia was identified.  It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally.  The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs.  The conjoint tendon was identified.  The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor.  The subscapularis tendon was identified.  It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later.  The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially.  This allowed for visualization of the capsule.  The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair.  It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position.  This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint.  The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified.  The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock.  The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely.  At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated.  The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry.  Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture.  This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry.  The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips.  0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia.  The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied.  The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition.","surgery, dislocating, bankart, arthroplasty, bankart repair, arthroscopic debridement, anterior, arthroscopic, debridement, deltoid, glenoid, humeral, interrupted, shoulder, subscapularis"

Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit., Surgery, Arthroplasty - Hammertoe ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Arthroplasty of the right second digit.,The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe.  The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications.","surgery, hammertoe deformity, arthroplasty, digit, proximal interphalangeal joint, periosteal tissue, interrupted sutures, interphalangeal joint, proximal phalanx, proximal, painful, tourniquet, hammertoe, phalanx, head, incisional, tendon"

Excision of plantar ulceration of the left fifth digit 3 cm x 1 cm in size.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient is a 38-year-old female with longstanding complaint of painful hammertoe deformity of her left fifth toe.  The patient had developed ulceration plantarly after being scheduled for removal of a plantar mass in the same area.  The patient elects for surgical removal of this ulceration and correction of her hammertoe deformity at this time.,After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was escorted to the OR where the patient was placed on the Operating Room table in the supine position.  After adequate amount of IV sedation was administered by Anesthesia Department, the patient was given a digital block to the left fifth toe using 0.5% Marcaine plain with 1% lidocaine plain in 1:1 mixture totaling 6 cc.  Following this, the patient was draped and prepped in a normal sterile orthopedic manner.  An ankle tourniquet was placed on the left ankle and the left foot was elevated and Esmarch bandage applied to exsanguinate the foot.  The ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 230 mmHg and then was brought back down to the level of the table.  The stockinette was then cut and reflected and held in place using towel clamp.,The skin was then cleansed using the wet and dry Ray-Tec sponge and then the plantar lesion was outlined.  The lesion measured 1 cm in diameter at the level of the skin and a 3 cm elliptical incision line was drawn on the surface of the skin in the plantolateral aspect of the left fifth digit.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, skin incision was made.  Following this, the incision was then deepened using a fresh #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue.  Using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the skin was reflected distally and proximally to the lesion.  The lesion appeared well encapsulated with fibrous tissue and through careful dissection using combination of sharp and drill instrumentation the ulceration was removed in its entirety.  The next further exploration was performed to ensure that no residual elements of the fibrous capsular tissue remained within.  The lesion extended from the level of the skin down to the periosteal tissue of the middle and distal phalanx, however, did not show any evidence of extending beyond the level of a periosteum.  Remaining tissues were inspected and appeared healthy.  The lesion was placed in the specimen container and sent to pathology for microanalysis as well as growth.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left fifth digit and using further dissection with a #15 blade, the periosteum was reflected off the lateral aspect of the proximal ________ median phalanx.  The capsule was also reflected to expose the prominent lateral osseous portion of this joint.  Using a sagittal saw and #139 blade, the lateral osseous prominence was resected.  This was removed in entirety.  Then using power-oscillating rasp, the sharp edges were smoothed and recontoured to the desirable anatomic condition.  Then the incision and wound was flushed using copious amounts of sterile saline with gentamycin.  Following this, the bone was inspected and appeared to be healthy with no evidence of involvement from the removed aforementioned lesion.,Following this, using #4-0 nylon in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures, the lesion wound was closed and skin was approximated well without tension to the surface skin.  Following this, the incision site was dressed using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Coban in a normal fashion.  The tourniquet was then deflated and hyperemia was noted to return to digits one through five of the left foot.  The patient was then escorted from the operative table into the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and was brought to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  In the recovery, the patient was given a surgical shoe as well as given instructions for postoperative care to include rest ice and elevation as well as the patient was given prescription for Naprosyn 250 mg to be taken three times daily as well as Vicodin ES to be taken q.6h. as needed.,The patient will follow-up on Friday with Dr. X in office for further evaluation.  The patient was also given instructions as to signs of infection and to monitor her operative site.  The patient was instructed to keep daily dressings intact, clean, dry, and to not remove them.","surgery, hammertoe deformity, plantolaterall, ulceration, arthroplasty, plantar ulceration, interphalangeal, painful hammertoe, proximal interphalangeal joint, interphalangeal joint, digit, toe, blade, deformity, incision, hammertoe, lesion"

Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon.  The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint.  An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch.  Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella.  There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter.  Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted.  While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal.  This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line.  A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed.  Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear.  The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia.  Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign.  PCL was also noted to be intact.  Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns.  It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle.  An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus.  It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee.  Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection.  The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured.  The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact.  Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella.  This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver.  It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well.  The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed.  20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly.,Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity.  At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.

His bilateral lower extremities were placed under traction on the Hana table.  His right leg was placed first.  The traction post was left line, and the left leg was placed in traction.  Sterile Hibiclens and alcohol prep and drape were then undertaken.  A fluoroscopic localization was undertaken.  Gentle traction was applied.  Narrow arthrographic effect was obtained.  Following this, the ProTrac portal was made under the fluoro visualization, and then, a direct anterolateral portal made and a femoral neck portal made under direct visualization.  The diagnostic arthroscopy showed the articular surface to be intact with a moderate anterior lip articular cartilage delamination injury that propagated into the acetabulum.  For this reason, the acetabular articular cartilage was taken down and stabilized.  This necessitated takedown of the anterior lip of the acetabulum and subsequent acetabular osteoplasty debridement with associated labral repair.  The labrum was repaired using absorbable Smith & Nephew anchors with a sliding SMC knot.  After stabilization of the labrum and the acetabulum, the ligamentum teres was assessed and noted to be stable.  The remnant articular surface of the femoral artery and acetabulum was stable.  The posterior leg was stable.  The traction was left half off, and the anterolateral aspect of the head and neck junction was identified.  A stable femoral neck decompression was accomplished starting laterally and proceeding anteriorly.  This terminated with the hip coming out of traction and indeterminable flexion.  A combination of burs and shavers was utilized to perform a stable femoral neck osteoplasty decompression.  The decompression was completed with thorough irrigation of the hip.  The cannula was removed, and the portals were closed using interrupted nylon.  The patient was placed into a sterile bandage and anesthetized intraarticularly with 10 mL of ropivacaine subcutaneously with 20 mL of ropivacaine and at this point was taken to the recovery room.

The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it.  There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was placed in supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision.  Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg.  The Veress needle was then removed.  A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen.  A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation.  Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation.  Photodocumentation was obtained.,A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant.  This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix.  Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization.  Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix.  Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix.  Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples.  Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure.  Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it.  The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site.  The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated.  The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic.  Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear.

He has been having significant feet pain with significant planovalgus deformity.  The patient was noted to have flexible vertical talus.  It was decided that the patient would benefit by subtalar arthrodesis, possible autograft, and Achilles lengthening.  This was explained to the mother in detail.  This is going to be a stabilizing measure and the patient will probably need additional surgery at a later day when his foot is more mature.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for other surgical procedures, need to be nonweightbearing for some time.  All questions were answered and the mother agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE NOTE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating room, general anesthesia was administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  Bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  A bump was placed underneath the left buttock.  Both the extremities were then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion.  Attention was first turned towards the left side.  Intended incision was marked on the skin.  The ankle was taken through a range of motion with noted improvement in the reduction of the talocalcaneal alignment with the foot in plantar flexion on the lateral view.  The foot was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 200 mmHg.  Incision was then made over the left lateral aspect of the hind foot to expose the talocalcaneal joint.  The sinus tarsi was then identified using a U-shaped flap to tack muscles, and periosteum was retracted distally.  Once the foot was reduced a Steinman pin was used to hold it in position.  This position was first checked on the fluoroscopy.  The 7/8th inch staple was then placed across the sinus tarsi to maintain the reduction.  This was also checked with fluoroscopy.  The incision was then extended posteriorly to allow for visualization of the Achilles, which was Z-lengthened with the release of the lateral distal half.  This was sutured using 2-0 Ethibond and that was also oversewn.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The periosteal flap was sutured over the staple using 2-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed using 2-0 Vicryl interrupted and then with 4-0 Monocryl.  The area was injected with 6 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local anesthetic.  The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s and Webril.  Tourniquet was released after 53 minutes.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the right side with no changes or complications.  Tourniquet time on the right side was 45 minutes.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Bilateral long-leg casts were then placed with the foot in neutral with some moulding of his medial plantar arch.  The patient was subsequently was taken to Recovery in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized overnight for pain as per parents' request.

The abdominal contents were within normal limits.  The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis.  A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty.  The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.  The omentum was freed.  The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  No abnormalities were noted.  At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed.  NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.  Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied.  Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results.  Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally.  The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis.  The last stitch was tied.  Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself.  At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered.  The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution.  The groins were repacked.  Attention was then returned to the abdomen.  The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present.  The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft.  The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position.  There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel.  At this point, the omentum and stomach were repositioned.  The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS.  The skin was closed with skin staples.

She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.

After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticularly, the joint was observed.  There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear.  The biceps complex was otherwise intact.  There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint.  Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface.  Subacromially, the same was true.  This was an elliptical to V-type tear.  The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department.  He was safely placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion.  Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly.  Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum.  The biceps was probed and noted to be intact.  Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment.,After this, instrumentation was removed.  The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created.  Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters.  An anterolateral portal was created.  Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire.  With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.  Superolateral portal was then created.  A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone.  _______ suture was placed.  The implant was put into place.  The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes.  There was excellent reduction of the tear.,Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory.,Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie.  A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion.,After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint.  Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements.  A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length.  0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon.  Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing.  The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis of this patient is fair.","surgery, subacromial decompression, rotator cuff repair, arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement, arthroscopy, glenoid labrum tear, glenoid labrum, cuff, tear, arthroscopic, subacromial, decompression, debridement, rotator, glenoid, labrum, shoulder,"

The patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese.,PROCEDURES: , Aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and two-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal,INCISION: , Median sternotomy,INDICATIONS: , The patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patient's severe diabetes.  The patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve.  In addition, The patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system.  The patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patient's right system.  It was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.,FINDINGS: , The left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied· The aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion.  It is a tricuspid type of valve.  The coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60% stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis.,The radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery.  Flow was excellent.  Looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory, there did not appear to be any large branches.  On the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small.  Because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patient's massive obesity, attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken.  The patient was brought to the operating room,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh.  The patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds.  There was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery.  Because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit The patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory.  The patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization.,The patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic cross-clamp was applied Cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner.  The patient was cooled to 32 degrees.  Iced slush was applied to the heart.  The aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision.  The valve leaflets were removed and the #23 St. Jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures.  At this point, aortotomy was closed.,The first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow.  Proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.  The left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an end-to-side manner.  The two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta.,The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic cross-clamp was released.  The patient was adequately warmed.  Protamine was given without adverse effect.  Sternal closure was then done using wires.  The subcutaneous layers were closed using Vicryl suture.  The skin was approximated using staples.","surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting, saphenous vein graft, radial artery graft, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, descending artery territory, aortic cross clamp, aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass, obtuse marginal artery, anterior descending artery, mechanical valve, artery bypass, bypass grafting, marginal artery, radial artery, aortic valve, coronary artery, anterior descending, descending artery, valve, artery, aortic, grafting,"

The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department.,The preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall.  A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation.  At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally.  A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view.  With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized.  The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken.  There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst.  Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant.  The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears.  Attention was turned to the suprapubic area.  The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified.  A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line.  Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline.  Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant.  There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.,The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.  The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.,The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline.  The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present.

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  We closed the peritoneum over the graft with 4-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The abdomen was closed with #1 nylon in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at end of case.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected only in a subplatysmal manner bluntly, and with only blunt dissection at the prevertebral space where a localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained, once self-retaining retractors were placed along the mesial edge of a cauterized longus colli muscle, to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case.  A prominent anterior osteophyte at C5-C6 was then localized, compared to preoperative studies in the usual fashion intraoperatively, and the osteophyte was excised with a rongeur and bony fragments saved.  This allowed for an annulotomy, which was carried out with a #11 blade and discectomy, removed with straight disc forceps portions of the disc, which were sent to Pathology for a permanent section.  Residual osteophytes and disc fragments were removed with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs as necessary as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements widely laterally as well.  A hypertrophied ligament and prominent posterior spurs were excised as well until the dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status.  At no time during the case was evidence of CSF leakage, and hemostasis was readily achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.  Once the decompression was inspected with a double ball dissector and all found to be completely decompressed, and the dura bulged at the interspace, and pulsated, then a Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and fusion putty and countersunk into position, and was quite tightly applied.  Further stability was added nonetheless with an appropriate size Uniplate, which was placed of appropriate size with appropriate size screws and these were locked into place in the usual manner.  The wound was inspected, and irrigated again with antibiotic solution and after further inspection was finally closed in a routine closure in a multiple layer event by first approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was Steri-Stripped for reinforcement, and a sterile dressing was applied, incorporating a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in the usual manner.  Once the sterile dressing was applied, the patient was taken from the operating room to the recovery area having left in stable condition.,At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type.","surgery, herniated nucleus pulposus, myelopathy, cervical spondylosis, cervical stenosis, anterior instrumentation, uniplate, decompression, anterior cervical discectomy, spinal cord, spinal canal, sterile dressing, interbody fusion, bengal cage, interbody, cervical, anterior, discectomy,"

This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1.,OPERATION IN DETAIL:,  The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters.  I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies.  The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates.  I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug.  Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place.  We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side.  This was filled with bone and BMP as well.  Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws.

We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion.  The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication.  The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut.  He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded.  The tape was placed and his arms were well padded.  He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region.  We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space.  We then marked the disc space.  We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space.  We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates.  We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well.  We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone.  We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space.  We then sized a 23-mm plate.  We inserted the screws nicely above and below.  We tightened down the lock-nuts.  We irrigated the wound.  We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate.  We then assured hemostasis once again.  We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion.  The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion.  The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this.  We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs.  I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case.","surgery, allograft fusion, anterior cervical discectomy, neck pain, cervical spine, discectomy, fusion, sternocleidomastoid muscle, assured hemostasis, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, disc space, cervical, anterior, allograft"

The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The head was placed on a well-padded head holder.  The eyes and face were protected from pressure.  A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The arms were tucked and draped to the sides.  All bony prominences were well padded.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision.  The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery.  The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided.  The midline structures were reflected to the right side.  Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected.  The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally.  An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7.,The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery.  The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally.  At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely.  Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space.  All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6.  The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur.  Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs.  The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies.  Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete.  A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression.  Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment.  The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings.  The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment.,In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter.  Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone.  The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space.  The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis.  The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces.  There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7.  A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position.  Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling.  An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis.  The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6.  Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures.  The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws.,An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts.,Blood loss was minimal.  The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics.  The wound was inspected and judged to be dry.  The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips.  The sponge and needle count were correct.  A sterile dressing was applied to the wound.  The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.",

The patient has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and subsequently, has been treated with pain medications, anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants.  The patient's symptoms continued to persist and subsequently, an MRI of the C-spine was done, which showed disc desiccation, spondylosis and herniated disk at C5-C6, an EMG and CV revealed a presence of mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.  The patient is now being recommended to undergo decompression and spinal instrumentation and fusion at C5-C6.  The patient understood the risks and benefits of the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be in the form of soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway for which she can be brought emergently back to the operating room for emergent evacuation of the hematoma as this may cause weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  This could also result in dural tear with its attendant symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and posterior neck pain as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  Should the symptoms be severe or the pseudomeningocele be large, she can be brought back to the operating room for repair of the CSF leak and evacuation of the pseudomeningocele.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and nonfusion, for which she may require redo surgery at this level.  There is also the possibility of nonimprovement of her symptoms in about 10% of cases.  The patient understands this risk on top of the potential injury to the esophagus and trachea as well as the carotid artery.  There is also the risk of stroke, should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled into the right cerebral circulation.  The patient also understands that there could be hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  She understood these risks on top of the risks of anesthesia and gave her consent for the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension and the head supported on a foam doughnut.  A marker was placed.  This verified the level to be at the C5-C6 level and incision was then marked in a transverse fashion starting from the midline extending about 5 mm beyond the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep after the head was turned 45 degrees to the left.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and the platysma was cut using a hot knife in a transverse fashion.  Dissection was then carried underneath the platysma superiorly inferiorly.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried out lateral to the esophagus to trachea as well as medial to the carotid sheath in the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The prevertebral fascia was noted to be taken her case with a lot of fat deposition.  Bipolar coagulation of bleeders was done; however, branch of the superior thyroid artery was ligated with Hemoclips x4.  After this was completed, a localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 level.  We proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of the C5 and C6.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid down.  An anterior osteophyte was carefully drilled using a Midas 5-mm bur and the disk together with the inferior endplate of C5 and the superior endplate of C6 was also drilled down with the Midas 5-mm bur.  This was later followed with a 3-mm bur and the disk together with posterior longitudinal ligament was removed using Kerrison's ranging from 1 to 4 mm.  The herniation was noted on the right.  However, there was significant neuroforaminal stenosis on the left.  Decompression on both sides was done and after this was completed, a Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  The area was then irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A 7 mm implant with its inferior packed with Vitoss was then laid down and secured in place with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws and plate 18 mm, all of which were titanium.  X-ray after this placement showed excellent position of all these implants and screws and _____ and the patient's area was also irrigated with saline with bacitracin solution.  A round French 10 JP drain was then laid down and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The catheter was then anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch and connected to a sterile draining system.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl subcuticular 4-0 Stitch for the dermis, and the wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  Dressing was placed only at the exit site of the catheter.  C-collar was placed.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery.",

She was intubated for anesthesia.  TEDS and boots as well as Foley catheter were placed.  She was placed in a supine position with her neck in neutral position.  Appropriate pads were also used.  The area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative localization was taken.  _____ not changed.  Incision was made on the right side in transverse fashion over C5 vertebral body level.  This was made with a #10 blade knife and further taken down with pickups and scissors.  The plane between the esophagus and carotid artery was carefully dissected both bluntly and sharply down to the anterior aspect of the cervical spine.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  Longus colli muscles were retracted laterally.  Caspar retractors were used.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  I first turned by attention at C5-C6 interspace.  This was opened with #15 blade knife.  Disc material was taken out using pituitary as well as Kerrison rongeur.  Anterior aspects were taken down.  End plates were arthrodesed using curettes.  This was done under distraction.  Posterior longitudinal ligament was opened with a nerve hook and Kerrison rongeur.  Bilateral foraminotomies were done.  At this point, I felt that there was a good decompression.  The foramen appeared to be opened.  Medtronic cage was then encountered and sent few millimeters.  This was packed with demineralized bone matrix.  The distraction was then taken down.  The cage appeared to be strong.  This procedure was then repeated at C4-C5.  A 42-mm AcuFix plate was then placed between C4 and C6.  This was carefully screwed and locked.  The instrumentation appeared to be strong.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken.  Irrigation was used.  Hemostasis was achieved.  The platysmas was closed with 3-0 Vicryl stitches.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces.  Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner.  Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided.  The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status.  The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed.  The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away.  Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements.,The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion.

Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification.,FIRST ASSISTANT: , Nurse practitioner.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion.  An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.  After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed.  The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion.  We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament.  There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.  That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor.,After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely.,We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws.

He was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A 4-cm incision was made obliquely over the left side of his neck.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the platysma.  The platysma was incised using electrocautery.  Blunt dissection was done to create a plane between the strap muscles and the sternoclavicular mastoid muscle.  This allowed us to get right down on to the anterior cervical spine.  Blunt dissection was done to sweep off the longus colli.  We isolated the C7-T1 interspace.  An x-ray was taken to verify; we were indeed at the C7-T1 interspace.,Shadow-Line retractor was placed as well as Caspar pins.  This provided very, very good access to the C7-T1 disk.,At this point, the operating microscope was brought into the decompression.,A thorough and aggressive C7-T1 discectomy was done using a succession of curettes, pituitary rongeur, 4-mm cutting bur and a #2 Kerrison rongeur.  At the end of the discectomy, the cartilaginous endplates were carefully removed using 4-mm cutting burr.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was carefully resected using #2 Kerrison rongeur.

Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4.  Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially.  The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5.  It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously.  We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5.,After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade.,Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation.  We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments.  This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur.  After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely.  We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well.  After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion.,We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place.

Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion.  A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues.  Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7.  Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen.  This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well.  This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed.  At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam.  Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7.  These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size.  The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc.  The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage.,Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition.  At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct.  There were no intraoperative complications of any type.","surgery, cervical spondylosis, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior instrumentation, annulotomy, kerrison rongeurs, surgifoam, vertebral space, uniplate construction, bengal cages, neural decompression, anterior cervical, cervical discectomy, interbody, anterior, cervical, discectomy"

Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening.  About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm.  The patient also noted shuffling gait.  The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation.  Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine.  MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes.  Based on these findings, I recommended decompression.  The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him.  Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient.  There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics.  However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation.  This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed.  There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele.  This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear.  There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid.  The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation.  The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  No monitoring leads were placed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders.  Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified.  Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace.  Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur.  The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur.  The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4.  There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side.  By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed.  Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder.  With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place.  An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws.  The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution.  Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch.  Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain.  C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities.",

His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness.  We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options.  Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections.  I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal.  Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break.  We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation.  I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone.  Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.  He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded.  Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case.  The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides.  A roll was placed between the shoulder blades.  The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion.  Ten pounds of traction was applied.  A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision.  The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle.  This was then split in line with its fibers.  Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized.  A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location.  The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit.  Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains.,Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes.  Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally.  Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression.  The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen.,A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace.  Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed.  The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field.  After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position.  There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace.  All weight was then removed from the crania tongs.,The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis.  Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5.  There was excellent purchase.  A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts.  The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase.,Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks.  The carotid pulse was strong.  A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware.  The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing.  The drain was hooked to bulb suction.  A Philadelphia collar was applied.,The cranial tongs were carefully removed.  The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone.  There was good hemostasis.,The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well.",

Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  Carotid sheath was retracted laterally.  Longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C5-C6.  We confirmed our position by taking intraoperative x-rays.  We then used the operating microscope and cleaned out the disk completely.  We then sized the interspace and then tapped in a #7 mm cortical cancellous graft.

The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07.  This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow.  She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear.  She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level.  Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level.  Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her.  Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function.  Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma.  There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics.  However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room.  Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft.  There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery.  There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid.  There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.  There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure.  She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case.  The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension.  The head was supported on a foam doughnut.  The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side.  A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm.  The area was then prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision.  The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles.  Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath.  The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply.  A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace.  Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7.  Self-retaining retractor was then laid out.  The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr.  The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7.  There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen.  This was carefully drilled down.  After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders.  They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam.  After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss.  The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws.  Irrigation of the area was done.  A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis.  The wound was reinforced with Dermabond.  The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site.  C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation.",

Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested.  We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.  Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed.  She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery.  Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively.,SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: , Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite.  General anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated.  The patient was noted to have pulse in this position.  Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision.  Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed.  The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease.  Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected.  Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally.  This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split.  Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels.  Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures.  Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur.  A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc.  Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace.  High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion.  Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura.  No further evidence of compression was identified.  Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam.  Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently.  Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set.  An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit.  This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit.  The graft was stable to pull-out forces.  Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws.  Plate and screws were then locked to the plate.  Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft.  Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline.  Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl.  Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma.  Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure.  The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.  All needle and sponge counts were correct.  Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal.","surgery, cervical spondylosis, cervical fusion, decompression, instrumentation, anterior cervical discectomy, anterior cervical, herniated disc, cervical discectomy, anterior, cervical, fusion, allograft, discectomy"

The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy.  A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3.  Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate.  We placed in self-retaining retractors.  With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5.  After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid.,We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal.  In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit.  It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis.  With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4.  We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4.  These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase.  We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves.  The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin.  Blood loss was about 50 mL.  No complication of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct.,The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb.  At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation.  At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain.  He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form.","surgery, abc plates, osteophyte, cervical, discectomy, cervical fusion, herniated nucleus pulposus, anterior cervical discectomy, nucleus pulposus, vertebral bodies, osteophyte formation, spinal stenosis, cervical discectomy, anterior, instrumentation, vertebral, stenosis, fusion"

Following the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  A shoulder roll was placed between the scapula and the head was rested on a doughnut in a slightly extended position.  A preoperative x-ray was obtained to identify the operative level and neck position.  An incision was marked at the C4-C5 level on the right side.  The incision was opened with #10 blade knife.  Dissection was carried down through subcutaneous tissues using Bovie electrocautery.  The platysma muscle was divided with the cautery and mobilized rostrally and caudally.  The anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle was then dissected rostrally and caudally with sharp and blunt dissection.  The avascular plane was then entered and dissection was carried bluntly down to the anterior cervical fascia.  This was opened with scissors and dissected rostrally and caudally with the peanut dissectors.  The operative level was confirmed with an intraoperative x-ray.  The longus colli muscles were mobilized bilaterally using bipolar electrocautery and periosteal elevator.  The anterior longitudinal ligament was then taken down with the insulated Bovie electrocautery tip exposing the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5.  Self-retaining retractor was placed in submuscular position, and distraction pins were placed in the vertebral bodies of C4 and C5, and distraction was instituted.  We then incise the annulus of C4-C5 and a discectomy was now carried out using pituitary rongeurs and straight and angled curettes.  Operating microscope was draped and brought into play.  Dissection was carried down through the disc space to the posterior aspect of the disc space removing the disc with the angled curette as we went.  We now use the diamond bit to thin the posterior bone spurs and osteophytes at the uncovertebral joints bilaterally.  Bone was then removed with 2 mm Kerrison punch and then we were able to traverse the posterior longitudinal ligament and this ligament was now removed in a piecemeal fashion with a 2 mm Kerrison punch.  There was a transligamentous disc herniation, which was removed during this process.  We then carried out bilateral foraminotomies with removal of the uncovertebral osteophytes until the foramina were widely patent.  Cord was seen to be pulsating freely behind the dura.  There appeared to be no complications and the decompression appeared adequate.  We now used a cutting bit to prepare the inner space for arthrodesis fashioning a posterior ledge on the posterior aspect of the C5 vertebral body.  An 8 mm lordotic trial was used and appeared perfect.  We then used a corticocancellous 8 mm lordotic graft.  This was tapped into position.  Distraction was released, appeared to be in excellent position.  We then positioned an 18 mm Vector plate over the inner space.  Intraoperative x-ray was obtained with the stay screw in place; plates appeared to be in excellent position.  We then use a 14 mm self-tapping variable angle screws in each of the four locations drilling 14 mm pilot holes at each location prior to screw insertion.  All of the screws locked to the plate and this was confirmed on visual inspection.  Intraoperative x-ray was again obtained.  Construct appeared satisfactory.  Attention was then directed to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  All of the self-retaining retractors were removed.  Bleeding points were controlled with bone wax and bipolar electrocautery.  The platysma layer was now closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with running 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  A sterile bandage was applied.  All sponge, needle, and cottonoid counts were reported as correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was subsequently extubated in the operating room and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition.","surgery, synthes vector plate, lordotic, acf spacer, corticocancellous, arthrodesis, anterior cervical discectomy, herniated nucleus pulposus, anterior, cervical, spacer, screws, discectomy, "

He has also noted to have cord signal at the C4-C5 level secondary to a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6.  Risks and benefits of the surgery including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of improvement were all discussed.  He understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Preoperative antibiotics were given.  The patient was placed in the supine position with all pressure points noted and well padded.  The patient was prepped and draped in standard fashion.  An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid.  Blunt dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and trachea and esophagus moved medially.  We then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found to be at C5-C6.  Distracting pins were placed in the body of C4 and in to the body of C6.  The disc was then completely removed at C4-C5.  There was very significant compression of the cord.  This was carefully removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord.  This was very severe and multiple free fragments were noted.  This was taken down to the level of ligamentum.  Both foramen were then also opened.  Other free fragments were also found behind the body of C5, part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all of these were removed.  The exact same procedure was done at C5-C6; however, if there were again free fragments noted, there was less not as severe compression at the C4-C5 area.  Again part of the body at C5 was removed to make sure that there was no additional constriction.  Both nerve roots were then widely decompressed.  Machine bone allograft was placed into the C4-C5 as well as C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body of C4 and to the body of C6 with a metal pin placed into the body at C5.  Excellent purchase was obtained.  Fluoroscopy showed good placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl, subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin.

Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left.  The patient has failed epidural steroid injections.  Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death.,OPERATIVE REPORT: , The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position.  After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body.  It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle.  The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine.  An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level.  Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed.  The disk was very degenerated and brown in color.  There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized.  A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally.  Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level.  Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed.  The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed.  A bilateral foraminotomy was performed.  Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides.  A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily.  Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo.  The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place.  There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally.  Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft.  The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin.  There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound.  A small drain was placed deep.  The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied.  The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events.

The pain has become more and more severe.  It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness.  If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm.  If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse.  He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery.  Surgery was discussed with him in detail.  A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended.  He understood and wished to proceed with surgery.  Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR.  There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae.  The neck was slightly extended and taped into position.  A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma.  Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery.  The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath.  The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine.  A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space.  An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure.  A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space.  The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure.  Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible.  Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body.  A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament.  A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina.  A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen.  After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated.  A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate.  So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk.  The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis.  A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated.  The patient was valsalved.  There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers.  The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin.  The wound was cleaned.,Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins.  Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck.  He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  There were no complications.","surgery, herniation, radiculopathy, interbody, mystique, bone implant, anterior cervical discectomy, neural foramina, mystique plate, disc herniation, arm radiculopathy, cervical discectomy, disk space, disk, cervical, anterior, wound, discectomy,"

Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem.  Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses.  The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck.  Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space.  Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4.  Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed.  Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed.  As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized.,There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs.  A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away.  I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura.,Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen.  The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas.  I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root.  All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura.  However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen.  An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact.,The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed.,Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration.  Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally.  Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well.  An x-ray showed good graft placement.,Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation.  A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws.  Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase.  Next, the locking screws were then applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws.  The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3.  The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs.  Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate.,Attention was turned to closure.  A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar.  The operation was then terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material.","surgery, herniated, osteophytes, nerve root decompression, harvesting, autologous, vertebral, arthrodesis, anterior technique, anterior cervical discectomy, spinal cord compression, fibular allograft bone, creation of arthrodesis, cervical discectomy, spinal instrumentation, cord compression, vertebral body, vertebral bodies, spinal cord, bone, instrumentation, cervical, anterior, grafting, spinal, discectomy, allograft, "

After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.","surgery, cervical disk protrusions, cervical radiculopathy, cervical pain, cervical plate fixation, sofamor danek titanium window plate, anterior cervical discectomy, vertebral body, vertebral, disk, intraoperative, anterior, decompression, fluoroscopy, radiculopathy, discectomy, cervical,"

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6.  There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5.  C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections.,A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels.  Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.,I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives.  He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position.  The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages.,The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,A transverse incision was made in the neck crease.  Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed.  The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine.  Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained.  A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization.,Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles.,First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space.  The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.,The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies.  The operating microscope was then utilized.,Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed.  I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen.  There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact.  However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.,The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5.  I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament.  The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces.  The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen.  The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it.  Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved.  Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression.  This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches.,Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space.  Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord.  I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord.  This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord.  I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right.  The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved.,Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration.  Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use.,Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis.  Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4.  Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge.  I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks.  The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft.,Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis.,Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation.  Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate.  The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush.  The holes were drilled and the screws were placed.  Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6.  All eight screws had good purchase.  The locking screws were tightly applied.  An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws.,Attention was turned to closure.  The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained.  A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin.  The wound was then carefully closed in layers.  Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition.  The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct.  There were no intraoperative complications.,Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue.",

Both groins were draped and sterilized in the usual fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with 2% lidocaine to the right groin area and a #6-French femoral sheath was inserted via modified Seldinger technique in the right common femoral artery.  Selective coronary angiography was performed with #6 French JL4 catheter for the left coronary system and a #6 French JR4 catheter of the right coronary artery.  Left ventricular catheterization and angiography was performed at the end of the procedure with a #6-French angle pigtail catheter.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics systemic blood pressure 140/70 mmHg.  LVEDP at the end of the procedure was 13 mmHg.,2.  The left main coronary artery is a large with mild diffuse disease in the distal third resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis at the take off of the left circumflex artery.  The left circumflex artery is a large caliber vessel with diffuse disease in the ostium of the proximal segment resulting in less than 30% angiographic stenosis.  The left circumflex artery gives rise to a high small obtuse marginal branch that has high moderate-to-severe ostium.  The rest of the left circumflex artery has mild diffuse disease and it gives rise to a second large obtuse marginal branch that bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk.,The LAD is calcified and diffusely disease in the proximal and mid portion.  There is mild nonobstructive disease in the proximal LAD resulting in less than 20% angiographic stenosis.,3.  The right coronary artery is dominant.  It is septal to be occluded in the mid portion.,The findings were discussed with the patient and she opted for PCI.  Angiomax bolus was started.  The ACT was checked.  It was higher in 300.  I have given the patient 600 mg of oral Plavix.,The right coronary artery was engaged using a #6-French JR4 guide catheter.  I was unable to cross through this lesion using a BMW wire and a 3.0x8 mm balloon support.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using a whisper wire.  I was unable to cross with this lesion using Cross-IT 100 wire.  I have also used second #6-French Amplatz right I guide catheter.  At one time, I have lost flow in the distal vessel.  The patient experienced severe chest pain, ST-segment elevation, bradycardia, and hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and atropine along with intravenous dopamine.,Dr. X was notified.,Eventually, an Asahi grand slam wire using the same 3.0 x 8 mm Voyager balloon support, I was able to cross into the distal vessel.  I have performed careful balloon angioplasty of the mid RCA.  I have given nitroglycerin under the nursing several times during the procedure.,I then performed arthrectomy using #5-French export catheter.,I performed more balloon predilation using a 3.0 x16 mm Voyager balloon.  I then deployed 4.0 x15 mm, excised, and across the mid RCA at 18 atmospheres with good angiographic result.  Proximal to the proximal edge of the stent, there was still some persistent haziness most likely just diseased artery/diffuse plaquing.  I decided to cover this segment using a second 4.0 x 15 mm, excised, and two stents were overlapped, the overlap was postdilated using the same stent delivery balloon at high pressure with excellent angiographic result.,Left ventricular catheterization was performed with #6-French angle pigtail catheter.  The left ventricle is rather smaller in size.  The mid inferior wall is minimally hypokinetic, ejection fraction is 70%.  There is no evidence of aortic wall stenosis or mitral regurgitation.,Femoral angiography revealed that the entry point was above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and I have performed this as Perclose hemostasis.,CONCLUSIONS,1.

The knots were trimmed. , Surgery, Ahmed Shunt Placement ,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,While in the holding area, the patient received a peripheral IV from the nursing staff.  In addition, pilocarpine 1% was placed into the operative eye, two times, separated by 10 minutes.  The patient was wheeled to the operating suite where the anesthesia team established peripheral monitoring lines.  Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were administered.  The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva.  Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant.  Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness.  This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade.  The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.  A trabeculectomy was done and then the tube was threaded through the trabeculectomy site.  The tube was sutured in place with a multi-wrapped 8-0 nylon suture.  The scleral flap was then sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed, rotated and buried.  A scleral patch was then placed of an appropriate size over the two.  It was sutured in place with interrupted 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture with a BV needle.  The anterior chamber was filled with Viscoat to keep it deep as the eye was somewhat soft.  A good flow was established with irrigation into the anterior chamber.  Homatropine, Econopred, and Vigamox drops were placed into the eye.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after removing the draping and the speculum.

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization suite where the right femoral region was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine solution was used to infiltrate the skin overlying the right femoral artery and vein.  Once adequate anesthesia has been obtained, a thin-walled #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral artery.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen without resistance.  A small nick was then made in the skin.  The pressure was held.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, a #6 French arterial sheath was then advanced over the guidewire into the vascular lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was flushed.  Next, an angulated pigtail catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under the direct fluoroscopy visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The catheter was then guided into the left ventricle.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The catheter was then flushed.  LVEDP was measured and found to be favorable for a left ventriculogram.  The left ventriculogram was performed in the RAO position with a single power injection of nonionic contrast material.  LVEDP was then remeasured.  Pullback was performed, which failed to reveal an LVAO gradient.  The catheter was then removed.  Next, a Judkins left #4 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  The ostium of the left main coronary was unable to be engaged with this catheter.  Thus it was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins left #5 catheter was advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Left main coronary artery was then engaged.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the left coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the left main coronary artery and was removed over a guidewire.  Next, a Judkins right #4 catheter was then advanced to the level of the ascending aorta under direct fluoroscopic visualization with the use of a guidewire.  The guidewire was removed.  The catheter was connected to the manifold and flushed.  Using hand injections of nonionic contrast material, the right coronary system was evaluated in several different views.  The catheter was then removed from the ostium of the right coronary artery and then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Because the patient did have high left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, it was determined that the patient wound need a right heart catheterization.  Thus an #18 gauge Argon needle was used to cannulate the right femoral vein.  A steel guidewire was inserted through the needle into the vascular lumen.  The needle was removed over the guidewire.  Next, an #8 French venous sheath was advanced over the guidewire into lumen without resistance.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed.  The sheath was then flushed.  Next, a Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced to the level of 20 cm.  The balloon was inflated.  Under fluoroscopic visualization, the catheter was guided into the right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery wedge position.  Hemodynamics were measured along the way.  PA saturation, right atrial saturation, femoral artery saturation were all obtained.  Once adequate study has been performed, the catheter was then removed.  Both sheaths were flushed and found fine.  The patient was returned to the cardiac catheterization holding area in stable satisfactory condition.,FINDINGS:,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAM:  ,There is no evidence of any wall motion abnormalities with estimated ejection fraction of 60%.

Completion angiogram.,FINDINGS:  ,This patient was brought to the OR with a non-severe stenosis of the proximal left superficial femoral artery in the upper one-third of his thigh.  He is also known to have severe calcific disease involving the entire left external iliac system as well as the common femoral and deep femoral arteries.,Our initial plan today was to perform an atherectomy with angioplasty and stenting of the left superficial femoral artery as necessary.  However, whenever we started the procedure, it became clear that there was a severe stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery at its takeoff from the left common femoral artery.  The area was severely calcified including the external iliac artery extending up underneath the left inguinal ligament.  Indeed, this ultimately was dissected due to manipulation of sheath catheters and sheath through the area.  Ultimately, this wound up being a much more complex case than initially anticipated.,Because of the above, we ultimately performed a laser atherectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, which then had to be angioplastied to obtain a satisfactory result.  The completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery, which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity.  We then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery.,The left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6-mm balloon.,The left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8-mm balloon.,A 2.5-mm ClearPath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper one-third of the thigh.  After the laser atherectomy was performed, the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done, which looked good; however, as noted above, after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery, we then had proximal inflow problems, which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting.,The patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion.,The right common femoral artery was used for access in an up-and-over technique.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.,The right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously, and a #5-French sheath was initially placed.  We used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff Amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery.  We then heparinized the patient and placed a #7-French Raby sheath over the Amplatz wire.  A selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the above-noted findings.,We then used a ClearPath 2.5-mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery.  Because of the findings as noted above, this became more involved than initially hoped for.  Once the laser atherectomy had been completed, the vessel still did not look good, so we used a 6-mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area.  Once that had been done, it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery.,Once that was discovered, we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level.,Once we had dealt with our run-on problems, we then did another completion angiogram, which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity.,Following completion of the above, all wires, sheaths, and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout.  He had good palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally on completion.  He was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Protamine was given to partially reverse the heparin.",

The patient is status post laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy BSO.  The patient was referred to me by Dr. X.  Because of the incomplete staging, the patient was advised to undergo a robotic-assisted surgical staging.  Risks, benefits, and rationale of these procedures were reviewed.  The patient has understanding of these risks and wishes to proceed with the surgery as planned.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS,1.  No evidence of ascites.,2.  At the time of the exploratory laparotomy, the diaphragm was well palpated.  They were clear.  The low attachments were removed.  The lesser omentum was unremarkable.  The pancreas, spleen, and liver were unremarkable.  The gallbladder was unremarkable.  The stomach appeared grossly normal.  The small bowel was inspected from the ligament which starts to the ileocecal valve.  There is no evidence of disease.  Paracolic gutter and peritoneum was free.  The omentum was grossly normal.,3.  In the pelvis, uterus, tubes, and ovaries were absent.  There was no evidence seeding along the bladder, pelvic, cul-de-sac, and peritoneum.,4.  Retroperitoneally, pelvic lymph nodes were mostly normal; however, at the right aortic, there are nodes.  These nodes were extremely fibrotic and they were densely adherent to the anterior wall of the vena cava which precluded me from performing a robotic periaortic lymph node dissection.  There was some area that was suspicious right at the low right periaortic lymph node.  They were sent for frozen section and they came back as benign.  It is unclear to me why did the lymph nodes were quite fibrotic and firm, but we will wait for the pathology report.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was given IV antibiotics prior to our incision site, sequential compression device was placed as part of the DVT prophylaxis.  I have requested an epidural catheter be placed for purpose of the periaortic lymph node dissection.  With this in mind, we proceeded as such.,We initially began with the robotic portion of the procedure.,A 1-cm supraumbilical incision made.  A Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was achieved to the abdominal pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12mm trocar was inserted without difficulty.  After completion of this, a 12mm trocar was placed in the left lower quadrant 2 fingerbreadths medial to the anterior superior iliac spine under direct laparoscopic visualization.  After completion of this, a laparoscope was then placed in the left lower quadrant port to assist in the placement of the remainder of the da Vinci ports.  Two 8-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant 8 cm apart while one 8-mm port was placed in the left upper quadrant 8 cm apart.  After completion of this, the patient was placed in steep Trendelenburg position.  The robotic system was then docked and after docking the robotic system, the instrumentation was inserted under direct laparoscopic visualization to ensure that there was no injury to the abdominal contents.  Once this was completed, the robotic camera was then docked.  We then proceeded with our daVinci portion of the procedure.,I then proceeded now with the omentectomy.  The omentum was taken off the transverse colon with the harmonic scalpel.  The entire omentum was removed and placed in the pelvis.  After completion of this, I then proceeded now with the pelvic lymph node dissection.,An incision was made parallel along the peritoneum overlying the psoas muscle.  All the lymph node bearing tissues along the external iliac artery and vein were subsequently skeletonized off the vessels and resected.  The lymph node bearing tissues interposed between the external iliac vein and psoas muscle were mobilized into the obturator fossa and subsequently removed off the accessory obturator vein, artery and nerve.  In the process of removing the lymphoid tissues, the genitofemoral nerve along with the accessory obturator vein, obturator artery and nerve were all preserved.  The lymphoid tissues interposed between the external iliac vein and psoas muscle along with the common iliac vessels were also subsequently removed.  The lymph node bearing tissues bifurcating at the hypogastric and the external iliac vein were likewise removed in addition to the hypogastric lymph nodes.  All the lymph node tissues were placed in an Endobag and removed and submitted as pelvic nodes on the right side and subsequently the left side.  Boundaries of the pelvic nodal dissection distally were the external circumflex iliac vein, laterally the psoas muscle along with the obturator internus fascia, medially the superior vesical artery along with the ureter, and inferiorly below the obturator nerve.,At this point in time, we have attempted the periaortic lymph node dissection.  I did open up the peritoneum overlying the bifurcation of the aorta.  This peritoneum was incised up to the level of the duodenal recess.  It was at this point in time that the periaortic lymph node dissection was extremely difficult.  I was unable to get a tissue plane as the lymph nodes were apparently very fibrotic.  I was concerned that I would tear off the anterior wall of the cava in the process of trying to perform the right periaortic lymph node.  For this reason, I aborted the robotic procedure or in after nearly attempting for about an hour and a half for the periaortic lymph nodes.  Once this was unsuccessful, the robotic system was then dedocked.  I then placed additional ports.  A 5-mm port was placed in the suprapubic region, two fingerbreadths above.  A right lower quadrant 12-mm port was placed.  After completion of this, I had attempted to see whether we could do the remainder of the periaortic lymph node dissection via laparoscopically.  Despite an attempt for a nearly 35 minutes, I was not able to get adequate exposure.  The small bowel kept on falling in the operative field which precluded us to perform the procedure safely.  For this reason, I converted to an open procedure.,A midline incision was made from suprapubic bone and extended above the umbilicus.  The abdominal cavity was entered without injuring the bell.  After entering the abdomen, omentum was removed.  Ray-Tec sponges were removed.  We covered for the Ray-Tec sponges.  After completion of this, Thompson retractor was placed.  The patient was placed in C-Trendelenburg position.  The bowel was packed cephalad.  Retroperitoneum space was entered right and left ureters were identified.  I then meticulously resected the lymphoid-bearing tissues anterior and lateral to the cava.  This dissection was quite difficult as the lymph nodes were extremely fibrotic and adherent to the caval wall.  I was able to freed up these lymph nodes without injuring of the cava.  Likewise, the left periaortic lymph node dissection was carried out from the level of the bifurcation to 1 cm above the IMA.  All the periaortic lymph node dissection was then carried out.  After completion of this, I then took washings.  Random biopsies were obtained of the cul-de-sac and right and left pelvic side wall along with the right and left paracolic gutter.  After completion of this, the patient appears to have tolerated the procedure well.  There was no obvious gross disease.  The bowel was inspected meticulously to ensure that there was no evidence of injury.  Once this was completed, the bowel was placed back to its normal position.  Several film solutions were placed.  We counted for sponges, needles, and instruments.  Once this was counted for, the fascia was then closed with #2 Vicryl suture in a mass closure fashion.  The subcutaneous route was copiously irrigated with water.  The JP drain was brought to the right lower quadrant incision.  All the incision ports were then closed with 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Likewise, the midline incision was closed with 3-0 Monocryl sutures.,At the conclusion of the procedure, there was no obvious gross disease left.,",

A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded.  Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  We turned our attention first towards the left side.  A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath.  Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut.  Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked.  This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture.  This was also oversewn.  Wound was then irrigated.  Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine.  It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril.  Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes.  The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes.  While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:  ,The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks.

The patient was placed in posterior splint and followed up at ABC orthopedics for further care.,PROCEDURE:,  After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedure were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, the operative surgeon, Department Of Anesthesia, and nursing staff.  While in this hospital, the Department Of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient.  The patient was then transferred to the operative table and placed in the prone position.  All bony prominences were well padded at this time.,A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh of the patient, but not inflated at this time.  Left lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Once this was done, the left lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg and kept up for a total of 40 minutes.  After all bony and soft tissue land marks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made paramedial to the Achilles tendon from its insertion proximal.  Careful dissection was then taken down to the level of the peritenon.  Once this was reached, full thickness flaps were performed medially and laterally.  Next, retractor was placed.  All neurovascular structures were protected.  A longitudinal incision was then made in the peritenon and opened up exposing the tendon.  There was noted to be complete rupture of the tendon approximately 4 cm proximal to the insertion point.  The plantar tendon was noted to be intact.  The tendon was debrided at this time of hematoma as well as frayed tendon.  Wound was copiously irrigated and dried.  Most of the ankle appeared that there was sufficient tendon links in order to do a primary repair.  Next #0 PDS on a taper needle was selected and a Krackow stitch was then performed.  Two sutures were then used and tied individually ________ from the tendon.  The tendon came together very well and with a tight connection.  Next, a #2-0 Vicryl suture was then used to close the peritenon over the Achilles tendon.  The wound was once again copiously irrigated and dried.  A #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to close the skin and subcutaneous fashion followed by #4-0 suture in the subcuticular closure on the skin.  Steri-Strips were then placed over the wound and the sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, Kerlix roll, sterile Kerlix and a short length fiberglass cast in a plantar position.  At this time, the Department of anesthesia reversed the anesthetic.  The patient was transferred back to hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was found upon excision of the cyst that it contained a large Prolene suture, which is multiply knotted as it always is; beneath this was a very small incisional hernia, the hernia cavity, which contained omentum; the hernia was easily repaired.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of an LMA anesthetic, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  The puncta of the wound lesion was infiltrated with methylene blue and peroxide.  The lesion was excised and the existing scar was excised using an ellipse and using a tenotomy scissors, the cyst was excised down to its base.  In doing so, we identified a large Prolene suture within the wound and followed this cyst down to its base at which time we found that it contained omentum and was in fact overlying a small incisional hernia.  The cyst was removed in its entirety, divided from the omentum using a Metzenbaum and tying with 2-0 silk ties.  The hernia repair was undertaken with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture with simple sutures.  The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular and Steri-Strips.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Dressings were applied and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, sebaceous cyst, prolene suture, incisional hernia, incisional, abscess, hernia, abdomen, omentum, excision, cyst,"
1278, Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax and rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.   Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.  , Surgery, Abdominal Exploration ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.,2.  Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION:  ,The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.,The lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.,The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.","surgery, intestinal, mesenteric, lymphangiectasia, ascites, chylothorax, lymphatic leak, infradiaphragmatic, abdominal exploration, congenital chylous, mesenteric lymphangiectasia, peritoneal cavity, chylous, abdominal, congenital, abdomen, lymphatic"

Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen.  CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision.  I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure.  Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery.,FINDINGS:,  The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia.  The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic.  This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well.,TECHNIQUE:  ,Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion.  The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette.  The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained.  I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining.  These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia.  The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze.  A dressing was applied.  The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition.","surgery, excisional debridement, subcutaneous tissue, abdominal wall abscess, foreign body, abdominal abscess, bovie cautery, abdominal, i&d, wound, incision, abscess,"

The patient had good support in the anterior vagina and in the posterior vagina but had significant apical prolapse.  Options such as watchful waiting, pessary, abdominal surgery, robotic sacrocolpopexy versus open sacrocolpopexy were discussed.,The patient already had multiple abdominal scars.  Risk of open surgery was little bit higher for the patient.  After discussing the options the patient wanted to proceed a Pfannenstiel incision and repair of the sacrocolpopexy.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, mesh erogenic exposure, complications with mesh were discussed.  The patient understood the risks of recurrence, etc, and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told to perform no heavy lifting for 3 months, etc.  The patient was bowel prepped, preoperative antibiotics were given.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel low abdominal incision was done at the old incision site.  The incision was carried through the subcutaneous tissue through the fascia and the fascia was lifted off the rectus abdominus muscle.  The muscle was split in the middle and peritoneum was entered using sharp mets.  There was no injury to the bowel upon entry.  There were significant adhesions which were unleashed.  All the adhesions in the sigmoid colon from the right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant were released, similarly colon was mobilized.  There was minimal space, everything was packed, Bookwalter placed then over the sacral bone.  The middle of the sacral bone was identified.  The right ureter was clearly identified and was lateral to where the posterior peritoneum was opened.  The ligament over the sacral or sacral __________ was easily identified, 0 Ethibond stitches were placed x3.  A 1 cm x 5 cm mesh was cut out.  This was a Prolene soft mesh which was tied at the sacral ligament.  The bladder was clearly off the vault area which was exposed, in the raw surface 0 Ethibond stitches were placed x3.  The mesh was attached.  The apex was clearly up enterocele sac was closed using 4-0 Vicryl without much difficulty.  The ureter was not involved at all in this process.  The peritoneum was closed over the mesh.  Please note that the peritoneum was opened and it was brought around and over the mesh so that the mesh would not be exposed to the bowel.  Prior to closure antibiotic irrigation was done using Ancef solution.  The mesh has been exposed in antibiotic solution prior to the usage.,After a through irrigation with L and half of antibiotic solution.  All the solution was removed.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  All the packing was removed.  Count was correct.  Rectus abdominus muscle was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl.  The fascia was closed using loop #1 PDS in running fascia from both sides and was tied in the middle.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure.  Please note that the Foley was in place throughout the entire procedure which was placed thoroughly at the beginning of the procedure.  Cystoscopy was done and indigo carmine has been given.  There was good efflux of indigo carmine in both of the ureteral opening.  There was no injury to the rectum or the bladder.  The bladder appeared completely normal.  The rectal exam was done at the end of the procedure after the cystoscopy.  After the cysto was done, the scope was withdrawn, Foley was placed back.  The patient was brought to recovery in the stable condition.","surgery, enterocele repair, cystoscopy, lysis of adhesions, enterocele, ethibond stitches, indigo carmine, vault prolapse, sacrocolpopexy, peritoneum, abdominosacrocolpopexy, "
